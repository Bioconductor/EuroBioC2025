    "text": "Professor of Statistics, Stanford University, USA\n\nBrought up in the French School of Data Analysis (Analyse des Données) in the 1980’s, Susan Holmes is a Data Scientist specialized in exploring and visualizing complex biological data. She is interested in integrating the information provided by phylogenetic trees, community interaction graphs and metabolic networks with sequencing data and clinical covariates. She uses computational statistics, in particular, nonparametric computer intensive methods such as the bootstrap and MCMC to draw inferences about many complex biological phenomena, interactions between the immune system and cancer, resilience and biomarker detection in the human microbiome and drug resistance in HIV. Her research group has developed open-source software implementing these methods, such as phyloseq and DADA2, which are freely available at the Bioconductor project for more than 10 years, and have become very popular among scientists analysing microbiome data. Susan enjoys teaching using R and BioConductor and tries to make everything she does freely available.\n\nhttps://susan.su.domains\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup Leader & Head of Outstation, EMBL Barcelona, Spain\n\nJames Sharpe is currently head of EMBL Barcelona and principal investigator of the group on Multicellular Systems Biology. The goal of his group is to understand how the activities of gene networks controls the millions of cells which make up our organs – allowing them to communicate with each other, to decide what to do at each moment during embryo development: whether to divide, which way to move, and which cells types to become (cartilage, bone, connective tissue, etc.). Their approach is to integrate information into a computer model, and to this end Sharpes’s research group develops new imaging and computational methods to understand one example of organogenesis – vertebrate limb development.\n\nhttps://www.embl.org/groups/sharpe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTenure Track Assistant Professor, EPFL, Switzerland\n\n…\n\nhttps://people.epfl.ch/maria.brbic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPostdoctoral Fellow, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France\n\n…\n\nhttps://jserizay.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPostdoctoral Fellow, CNAG, Barcelona, Spain\n\nHelena Crowell obtained her Ph.D. in Epidemiology & Biostatistics with Mark Robinson at the University of Zurich in Switzerland, where she developed and benchmarked methods for single-cell and spatial omics data, and authored various R/Bioconductor packages (CATALYST, muscat, and SpatialExperiment). As a postdoc with Holger Heyn, she is collaborating with clinicians and biotech companies to analyze spatial transcriptomics data in an immuno-oncology context, e.g., chronic lymphocytic leukemia and colorectal cancer. Aside from her research, she is a Bioconductor package reviewer and member of the project’s technical advisory board.\n\nhttps://helenalc.github.io"

Furthermore, we require all participants to have identifiable accounts in Bioconductor online forums. Accounts that do not adhere to this after request to de-anonymise may be deleted.\nWe do not tolerate harassment, intimidation, or bullying of community members.

If you are uncomfortable reporting to the Code of Conduct committee as a group, you can contact any individual committee member via email or a direct message on the community-bioc Slack channel. Please include screenshots/copies of all relevant electronic conversations whenever possible (you don’t need to compromise your anonymity!).\nWe can’t follow up an anonymous report with you directly, but we will fully investigate it and take whatever action is necessary to prevent a recurrence.\n\n\n\nYou can make a personal report to any member of the event Code of Conduct committee present at an event.\nWhen taking a personal report, we will ensure you are safe and cannot be overheard. We may involve other event staff to ensure your report is managed properly. Once safe, we’ll ask you to tell us about what happened.

You won’t be asked to confront anyone, and we won’t tell anyone who you are.\nOur team will be happy to help you get the relevant support (e.g. help contacting hotel/venue security, local law enforcement, local support services, provide escorts, or otherwise assist you to feel safe for the duration of the event).\nWe value your attendance and participation at Bioconductor events and in our community.\n\n\n\nWe understand that you may want a person unrelated to Bioconductor overseeing your conflict resolution. To facilitate this, the Code of Conduct Committee will appoint an ombudsperson from a different open source community than members of the Bioconductor project. While they do not have power to establish, change or set aside decisions made by the Code of Conduct Committee, they can assist community members by offering consultation, mediation, coaching and referrals to other resources. The ombudsperson can be contacted directly via email (see below) to ensure a confidential, impartial, informal and independent process.\n\n\n\nThe Code of Conduct Committee follows a standard procedure to deal with conflicts.
