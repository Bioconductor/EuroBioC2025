All conference materials (videos, slides, talks, posters, workshops) are published online such that the conference provides a rich resource for learning Bioconductor.\n\n\nPlease contact eurobioc@bioconductor.org\nYour sponsorship will help increase diversity and representation at the European Bioconductor Conference 2025 by:\n\nKeeping registration costs affordable for academic participants and trainees.\nProvide high quality hybrid/virtual streaming and post-production and sharing of videos and conference materials.\nProviding caregiver awards to assist with childcare or eldercare costs.\nOffering student diversity scholarships to increase participation of underrepresented minorities.\n\nFour levels of sponsorship are available. Sponsors of all levels may give a short talk and/or present a poster highlighting the scientific interests of their organization in the poster session; for this, sponsors are kindly requested to submit an abstract within the deadline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiamond\n\n\nGold\n\n\nSilver\n\n\nBronze\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10000 EUR\n\n\n6000 EUR\n\n\n3000 EUR\n\n\n1000 EUR\n\n\n\n\nConference dinner & one keynote speaker announced in your name\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne poster session announced in your name\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBooth for the duration of the conference\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBooth during one day of the conference\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuarantee to present a poster (abstract submission required)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\nFree in-person registrations\n\n\n3\n\n\n2\n\n\n1\n\n\n0\n\n\n\n\nLogo on website and in all promotional material\n\n\nlarge\n\n\nbasic\n\n\nbasic\n\n\nbasic\n\n\n\n\nThank you posts on our social media platforms\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\nPromotion of your company on our social media platforms\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\nX\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMailing list for attendees who opt in to receive communications\n\n\nX"
