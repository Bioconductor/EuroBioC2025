# Carpentry-workshops

Right before EuroBioC2025 starts, on Monday and Tuesday 15th and 16th of
September, the
[Bioconductor training committee](https://training.bioconductor.org) organizes
the following two-day Bioconductor Carpentry Workshops:

* **[Analysis and interpretation of bulk RNA sequencing data with Bioconductor](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/bioc-rnaseq):**
  This course shows how to use Bioconductor packages to analyse bulk RNA-seq
  data including how to import and annotated quantified data into R, exploratory
  analysis and quality control, differential expression analyais and gene set
  enrichment analysis. Pre-requisites: familiarity with R and Bioconductor.
  **Instructors:** Vasileios Panagoitis Lenis and Jacques Serizay.

* **[Analysis and interpretation of single-cell RNA sequencing data with Bioconductor](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/bioc-scrnaseq):**
  This course shows how to use Bioconductor packages for essential single-cell
  analysis steps including quality control, cell type annotation, multi-sample
  analysis, working with large data, and integration with public data.
  Pre-requisites: familiarity with R and Bioconductor, familiarity with bulk RNA-seq
  data analysis is beneficial, but not strictly required. **Instructors:**
  Robert Iv√°nek and Kevin Rue-Albrecht.

## Registration

Details to register for the pre-conference Carpentries workshops will
appear soon. Stay tuned!

## What is a Bioconductor Carpentry Workshop

[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org) is a global community focused on
teaching foundational coding and data science skills to researchers. The core
of this community are
[Carpentries Instructors](https://carpentries.org/community/instructors), who
work together to grow their instructional and technical skills. Bioconductor is
a member of The Carpentries, supporting community members to earn Carpentries
instructor certification, develop Bioconductor-specific training materials, and
teach Carpentry workshops on those materials.

A Bioconductor Carpentry Workshop is a course on how to use Bioconductor packages
and workflows, given by Carpentry-certified instructors on materials developed
by the Bioconductor community.
