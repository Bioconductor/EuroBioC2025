# Carpentry-workshops

Right before EuroBioC2025 starts, on Monday and Tuesday 15th and 16th of
September, the
[Bioconductor training committee](https://training.bioconductor.org), joinly
with the
[Department of Medicine and Life Sciences (MELIS)](https://www.upf.edu/biomed)
at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra, organizes the following two-day Bioconductor
Carpentry Workshops:

* **[Analysis and interpretation of bulk RNA sequencing data with Bioconductor](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/bioc-rnaseq):**
  This course shows how to use Bioconductor packages to analyse bulk RNA-seq
  data including how to import and annotated quantified data into R, exploratory
  analysis and quality control, differential expression analysis and gene set
  enrichment analysis. Pre-requisites: familiarity with R and Bioconductor.
  **Instructors:** Estefania Mancini, Vasileios Panagoitis Lenis and Jacques Serizay.

* **[Analysis and interpretation of single-cell RNA sequencing data with Bioconductor](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/bioc-scrnaseq):**
  This course shows how to use Bioconductor packages for essential single-cell
  analysis steps including quality control, cell type annotation, multi-sample
  analysis, working with large data, and integration with public data.
  Pre-requisites: familiarity with R and Bioconductor, familiarity with bulk RNA-seq
  data analysis is beneficial, but not strictly required. **Instructors:**
  Robert Ivánek and Kevin Rue-Albrecht.

Each workshop takes two days, so you should either register for one or the other.

## Venue and requirements

The Bioconductor Carpentry Workshops will take place at the School of Medicine
and Life Sciences of the Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF, see
[https://www.upf.edu/biomed](https://www.upf.edu/biomed)), right next to the
[PRBB](https://prbb.org) building, where EuroBioC2025 will take place.
Participants are expected to bring their own laptop to follow the course. The
rooms will have electric sockets to plug AC adapters and wireless internet
connection. Eduroam WiFi will be available and participants without Eduroam
will be able to connect to a guest UPF WiFi network, but will need a mobile
telephone device to authenticate in the guest network.

## Registration

The fee for each workshop is €120, including lunch and coffee breaks.
**Registration is now open at
[https://eventum.upf.edu/go/eurobioc2025CarpentryWorkshops](https://eventum.upf.edu/go/eurobioc2025CarpentryWorkshops){target="_blank"}**. Places are limited to 30 spots per
workshop. Hurry up if you want to secure yours!

## What is a Bioconductor Carpentry Workshop

[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org) is a global community focused on
teaching foundational coding and data science skills to researchers. The core
of this community are
[Carpentries Instructors](https://carpentries.org/community/instructors), who
work together to grow their instructional and technical skills. Bioconductor is
a member of The Carpentries, supporting community members to earn Carpentries
instructor certification, develop Bioconductor-specific training materials, and
teach Carpentry workshops on those materials.

A Bioconductor Carpentry Workshop is a course on how to use Bioconductor packages
and workflows, led by Carpentry-certified instructors on materials developed
by the Bioconductor community.
