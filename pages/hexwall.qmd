# Sticker-Hexwall

We’re planning a sticker hexwall for EuroBioc2025, a visual display of Bioconductor package stickers that may be featured in the event space. If feasible, it would be a fun way to highlight the diversity of the Bioconductor ecosystem. A photo-call might also be possible, depending on final logistics.

If the physical display cannot go ahead for any reason, we still plan to showcase the hexwall on the conference website.

## Preview draft Hexwall

You can view the full-resolution hexwall and explore the included packages on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/15880369)

This is a draft layout. The final version will include all new submissions received by the deadline.
