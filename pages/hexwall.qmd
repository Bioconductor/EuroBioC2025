# Sticker-Hexwall

We are planning a sticker hexwall for EuroBioc2025, a visual display of Bioconductor package stickers that will be displayed in a photo-call at the conference. It will be a fun way to highlight the diversity of the Bioconductor ecosystem. We have produced two designs, one using the musical note of the Bioconductor logo, and another one using an hexagonal shape. These two designs were crafted by [Kevin Rue-Albrecht](https://kevinrue.github.io){target="_blank"} with the input of the rest of the [EuroBioC2025 organising committee](organizers.qmd).
