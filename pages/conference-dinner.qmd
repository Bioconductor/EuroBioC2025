The four main options to reach it from the conference venue are:

* **Walking (~1 hr uphill)**
  (see [Google directions](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3E7atKv9oPsVocAo7){target="_blank"}).
* **By bus (~40 minutes).** Taking the bus
  [V21](https://www.tmb.cat/en/barcelona/buses/-/lineabus/V21){target="_blank"}
  starting at the stop on the corner between Trelawny and Passeig Marítim, at the
  seafront, and stepping out ten stops later at Padilla with Indústria. From
  that stop, it is a 5-minute walk going uphill to Sant Antoni Maria Claret, and
  going right till the corner of this street with Carrer Cartegena (see
  [Google directions](https://maps.app.goo.gl/F7LrejShzpUtyFJ58){target="_blank"}).

* **By subway (~35 minutes).** Taking the
  [L4 (yellow) line](https://www.tmb.cat/en/barcelona/metro/-/lineametro/L4){target="_blank"}
  direction Trinitat Nova, starting at the stop Ciutadella - Vila Olímpica, which
  is about 10 minutes walking from the conference venue, stepping out 9 stops
  later in Guinardó - Hospital de Sant Pau. From there, you will be at the opposite
  corner of the entrance you should take to the old hospital complex, and you will have to walk
  about 10 minutes, first downhill through the Sant Quintí street, then turn right to
  the Sant Antoni Maria Claret street, until you find the entrance at the corner with
