He was an inaugural faculty member in the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Summer Course on statistical analysis of genome-scale data (2005-2010 and intermittently thereafter), and in 2009 was inaugural Editor-in-Chief of The R Journal. A founding contributor to the Bioconductor project in 2001, Vince is now MPI of the NHGRI U24 supporting Bioconductor core developer activities. He is also MPI of the NHGRI AnVIL cloud computing platform. Vince has led several Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative Essential Open Source Software projects addressing enhanced community support and inclusiveness. One outcome is the YESCDS curriculum for introductory genomic data science with applications to cancer. As of 2024 Vince is a member of the Scientific Advisory Board of the Vaccine and Immunology Statistical Center of the Collaboration for AIDS Vaccine Discovery, and of the External Advisory Board for NIAID ImmPort."

  txt: "Brought up in the French School of Data Analysis (Analyse des Données) 
  in the 1980’s, Susan Holmes is a Data Scientist specialized in exploring and 
  visualizing complex biological data. She is interested in integrating the 
  information provided by phylogenetic trees, community interaction graphs and 
  metabolic networks with sequencing data and clinical covariates. She uses 
  computational statistics, in particular, nonparametric computer intensive 
  methods such as the bootstrap and MCMC to draw inferences about many complex 
  biological phenomena, interactions between the immune system and cancer, 
  resilience and biomarker detection in the human microbiome and drug resistance 
  in HIV. Her research group has developed open-source software implementing 
  these methods, such as phyloseq and DADA2, which are freely available at the 
  Bioconductor project for more than 10 years, and have become very popular 
  among scientists analysing microbiome data. Susan enjoys teaching using R and 
  Bioconductor and tries to make everything she does freely available."

  investigator of the group on Multicellular Systems Biology. The goal of
  his group is to understand how the activities of gene networks controls
  the millions of cells which make up our organs – allowing them to
  communicate with each other, to decide what to do at each moment during
  embryo development: whether to divide, which way to move, and which
  cells types to become (cartilage, bone, connective tissue, etc.). Their
  approach is to integrate information into a computer model, and to this
  end Sharpes's research group develops new imaging and computational methods
  to understand one example of organogenesis – vertebrate limb development."

  Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG), in Barcelona. Using deep unsupervised
  learning, Noelia's group develops computational and experimental approaches
  to understand and design protein functions. She obtained her Ph.D. from
  Pompeu Fabra University, Barcelona, where she investigated the use of machine
  learning techniques for molecular simulations. After working for a short
  period in industry (Acellera Labs in Barcelona and Pfizer in Boston), she
  joined the University of Bayreuth, Germany, as a postdoctoral researcher,
  developing AI generative models for protein design. Since 2023, she leads her
  own research group, first at the Institute of Molecular Biology in Barcelona,
  and now at the CRG. On 2022 she was awarded the L'Oréal-UNESCO Prize for
  Women in Science, and on 2024 an ERC Starting Grant."

  txt: "Jacques Serizay is a computational biologist at the Institut Pasteur, 
  Paris, focusing on leveraging large-scale sequencing data to uncover the 
  complexities of chromatin structure, gene regulation, and epigenetic 
  modifications. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Cambridge, where 
  he investigated tissue-specific chromatin organization and transcriptional 
  regulation in Caenorhabditis elegans. His postdoctoral research at the 
  Institut Pasteur further explores the interplay between sequence composition 
  and chromatin architecture in controlling gene regulation. <br>
  Jacques’ research aims to elucidate how these molecular mechanisms influence 
  gene expression during development and in synthetic biological systems. 
  In addition to his scientific contributions, Jacques is actively involved in 
  the development of advanced software tools to support the integration and 
  analysis of large-scale genomic data. He is the author of the online book 
  “Orchestrating Hi-C analysis with Bioconductor” and has developed several 
  Python and Bioconductor packages for Hi-C and epigenomic data analysis. 
  As an active member of the tidyomics group, he also contributes to the 
  development of a tidy ecosystem for genomics."
