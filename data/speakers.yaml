  with Mark Robinson at the University of Zurich in Switzerland, where she 
  developed and benchmarked methods for single-cell and spatial omics data, 
  and authored various R/Bioconductor packages (*CATALYST*, *muscat*, and 
  *SpatialExperiment*). As a postdoc with Holger Heyn, she is collaborating 
  with clinicians and biotech companies to analyze spatial transcriptomics 
  data in an immuno-oncology context, e.g., chronic lymphocytic leukemia and 
  colorectal cancer. Aside from her research, she is a Bioconductor package 
  reviewer and member of the project's technical advisory board."
