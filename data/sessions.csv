Wed,Poster,,,smartid: Overcoming Challenges in Rare Cell Population Marker Identification from Single-Cell RNA-seq,,,,,,,,,,,,,Jinjin Chen,,,,,"Accurate identification of cell types and states is a crucial step when analysing single cell RNA-seq data. Inaccurate cell type annotation leads to spurious results and biological interpretations in subsequent analyses. Cell type identification is traditionally done using established marker genes of each cell population. However, many existing methods do not perform well for imbalanced cell populations, which often occurs in the presence of rare cell types. Most existing methods tend to be biased towards the dominant cell populations or highly expressed genes, leading to inaccurate results. Here, we introduce the package smartid, which accurately identifies markers from even imbalanced data across batches by employing a modified Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency with Gaussian Mixture Model. smartid is also a gene-set scoring method which is able to distinguish the target group of interest. smartid is implemented in R and is freely available on Bioconductor at https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/smartid.html.",chen.j@wehi.edu.au,,,,,
Thu,Poster,,,The contribution of leukocytes to cerebral malaria vascular pathogenesis in a 3D blood-brain barrier model,,,,,,,,,,,,,Alina Batzilla,,,,,"Cerebral Malaria (CM) is a severe neurovascular complication of Plasmodium falciparum infections, in children characterized by brain swelling due to blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption. Postmortem samples provide evidence of immune cells accumulating in the microvasculature of CM patients, suggesting a role of proinflammatory immune response in the pathogenesis of the disease. However, it remains unclear whether leukocyte activation and accumulation are primary contributors to BBB breakdown or merely a consequence of BBB damage. We used a systems immunology approach comprised of an engineered 3D-BBB model and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to study leukocyte interactions with the BBB in CM pathogenesis. After stimulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy donors with P. falciparum (Pf-PBMC), we perfused them through the 3D-BBB model. scRNAseq analysis confirmed activation of T-cells, monocytes, and NK cells, and revealed increased binding of Pf-PBMC to resting brain endothelial cells. This increased binding was mostly driven by CD8+ and innate-like T-cells and associated with activation and conformational change of the binding receptor LFA1, quantified by FACS. We identified three transcriptional modules in BBB cells that were differentially expressed upon Pf-PBMC exposure. One inflammatory module was shared between endothelial cells and pericytes and could mostly be attributed to TNFa and IFNg released by monocytes, T-cells, and NK cells. The two remaining, endothelial-specific modules included genes associated with cytoskeletal processes and apoptosis suggestive of barrier dysfunction. Permeability measurements in the 3D-BBB confirmed an increased permeability caused by Pf-PBMC. Vascular disruption was dependent on cytoadhesion of Pf-PBMC as barrier function could be restored by blocking endothelial-leukocyte interactions using an anti-ICAM1 monoclonal antibody. Additionally, we demonstrate how the presented data can be used to disentangle which pathogenic features observed in human CM are likely to be caused by immune cells or P. falciparum-infected red blood cells respectively.",alina.batzilla@embl.de,,,,,
Wed,Poster,,,miaDash: a web app for reproducible and interactive microbiome analysis and visualisation,,,,,,,,,,,,,Giulio Benedetti,,,,,"Microbiome data can reveal valuable insights into the communities of microorganisms that inhabit our world and greatly shape not only the environment but also human health. As microbiome profiling became a standard routine in biomedical and ecological research, the R/Bioconductor community has created a reproducible framework for microbiome data analysis, which is based on optimised containers for hierarchical multi-table data, in particular the TreeSummarizedExperiment class. While this framework is easily accessible to experienced R users, experiment-driven researchers may seek a more user-friendly option for microbiome analysis and visualisation. To reduce the entry requirements to this field, we developed miaDash, an R shiny app that builds on top of the R/Bioconductor framework to provide a graphical user interface for interactive microbiome analysis and exploration. miaDash allows users to import, manipulate, analyse and ultimately visualise microbiome data, without the need for knowledge of R programming. We aim for miaDash to support both new and experienced users in promoting microbiome research and discovery.",giulio.benedetti@utu.fi,,,,,
Thu,Poster,,,Improved dataset integration for cancer scRNA-seq data with anglemania,,,,,,,,,,,,,Aaron Kollotzek,,,,,"Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers unprecedented resolution for characterizing cellular heterogeneity, but its interpretation is often affected by substantial technical noise. This uncharacterized noise often obscures true biological patterns and can lead to spurious conclusions. Although current integration methods attempt to correct for such technical effects, they frequently do so at the cost of diminishing meaningful biological variation which is particularly problematic in cancers, where subtle differences in cell states are critical.
To address this challenge, we developed anglemania, a novel feature extraction method that acts upstream of integration algorithms and enhances biological signal fidelity by leveraging the stability of gene-gene co-variation across batches. anglemania systematically identifies genes whose expression relationships remain consistent despite technical noise, thereby prioritizing features that reflect genuine biology. In simulated datasets we showed that anglemania effectively extracts biologically relevant genes. These genes drastically improved dataset integration in various scenarios compared to using the commonly selected highly variable genes. We applied this approach to neuroblastoma scRNA-seq datasets, aiming to achieve a unified cellular description of the disease.
Our analysis revealed a robust seven-cluster manifold shared across two separate integrations including multiple patient samples from different datasets. Notably, we identified mesenchymal-like cell populations exhibiting Schwann cell precursor signatures in both integrations. Furthermore, we discovered a distinct mesenchymal subtype characterized by the activation of inflammatory gene programs, suggesting additional layers of complexity in the tumor microenvironment.
By prioritizing stable biological relationships and minimizing technical confounding, anglemania improves the interpretability and reliability of scRNA-seq data analysis in cancer contexts. We anticipate broad utility for this method across diverse single-cell studies, particularly where reproducibility and comparability are essential for deriving meaningful biological insights.",aaron.kollotzek@mdc-berlin.de,,,,,
Wed,Poster,,,Orchestrating Microbiome Analysis with Bioconductor,,,,,,,,,,,,,Tuomas Borman,,,,,"Microbes play a pivotal role in human health and disease, yet the mechanisms underlying these interactions remain largely unknown due to their complexity. Microbiome research faces challenges related to scalability, interoperability, and a lack of standardization. Studies have grown in terms of both sample size and data dimensionality. While sequencing data forms the foundation of most analyses, other omics layers are increasingly incorporated to provide a more holistic view. However, integration of multi-omics datasets is still poorly supported. Moreover, limited interoperability between tools has hindered efficient multi-omics analysis, and heterogeneous analytical approaches have reduced reproducibility and transparency.
To address these challenges, we have developed a microbiome data science ecosystem built around the TreeSummarizedExperiment class—an extension of Bioconductor’s core SummarizedExperiment container. This design choice enables scalable and efficient data management while ensuring interoperability with the broader Bioconductor ecosystem. A comprehensive suite of tools for microbiome data science is implemented across multiple R/Bioconductor packages, which collectively form the mia (Microbiome Analysis) package family.
The ecosystem is documented in the Orchestrating Microbiome Analysis (OMA) online book, which not only provides practical examples but also promotes best practices in microbiome research. The project is community-driven, actively growing with contributions from independent developers—and we welcome all new contributors.

Thu,Poster,,,Writing custom linters for package developers and their users,,,,,,,,,,,,,Hugo Gruson,,,,,"Linting is a common task across programming languages to automatically detect potentially erroneous or suboptimal code patterns. In R, the lintr package proposes an extensive set of linting rules out of the box (to, e.g., recommend the faster anyNA() function over any(is.na())). These rules are based on either objective criteria, such as increased performance or portability, or on widely accepted community style guides, such as the tidyverse style guide.

However, package authors may sometimes want to create their own rules that cannot make it into the lintr package itself.
Typically, this can happen in two main situations:
- when you want all package contributors, including your future self, to stick to a certain style or to specific patterns. This strategy is used by the pkgdown developers to ensure they remember to use functions from the cli package to interact with the users.
- when you deprecate certain arguments or coding patterns in your package, and you want to make it easy for your users to identify which portions of their code they should update to use the new recommended pattern. This require making your new linting rules accessible to users by exporting them and listing them in inst/lintr/linters.csv

Writing new linters may seem like a daunting challenge. But in most cases, it doesn't require a deep knowledge of the R parser. Indeed, the lintr package now provides helpers to streamline the creation of linters, sometimes by just providing the name of the function to avoid.

This poster will demonstrate:
- how your development team can benefit from writing custom linters
- how your package users can benefit from you writing custom linters
- how to write these the linters and expose them to your users in practice

Wed,Poster,,,A Bioconductor workflow for microbiome-based survival analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,Sneha Das,,,,,"There is growing interest in exploring how the human microbiome influences human health. This is no longer limited to cross-sectional association studies alone. With the increasing availability of cohorts with considerable follow-up times, researchers are now also turning to time-to-event, or survival analysis, studies to examine the link between the taxonomic, functional, and other features of microbiome, and the occurrence of significant events- typically the onset of certain diseases or mortality. The accumulation of well phenotyped microbiome cohorts with a substantial follow-up time profiling has made it easier to analyze the association between microbes and future health status. Despite the growing interest, the current studies remain limited by methodological challenges. The complex and compositional microbiome data sets necessitate specialized statistical approaches.There is a lack of comprehensive methods and limited availability of R packages to support microbiome-based survival analyses, and benchmarking studies comparing the available methods in microbiome data sets. We compare methods for microbiome-based survival analysis and introduce a Bioconductor workflow for microbiome-based survival analysis using the (Tree)SummarizedExperiment framework and the mia package. This can support future survival analysis studies in future cohort studies. ",snedas@utu.fi,,,,,
Thu,Poster,,,Comprehensive Profiling of T Cells and Tertiary Lymphoid Structures in Glioma Using Spatial  and Single-Cell Transcriptomics,,,,,,,,,,,,,Charles Gwellem Anchang,,,,,"Adult-type diffuse gliomas, the most common primary brain tumors, pose significant clinical challenges due to limited treatment options, an immune-suppressive microenvironment, and poor prognosis. Immune cell aggregates also known as tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS)  drive intratumoral adaptive immune responses, but their exact function in gliomas is unknown. To better understand the spatial and functional heterogeneity of adaptive immune cells within glioma-associated TLS, we performed whole-transcriptome profiling and adaptive immune receptor sequencing at both spatial and single cell resolution in patient-derived glioma samples. 
In the first step we applied the CHOIR algorithm (Sant et al. 2025) for unbiased clustering and refined annotation of T cell subtypes in the single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset. This aproach enabled the identification of diverse cytotoxic, regulatory and helper T cell phenotypes. Using a combination of different R/Bioconductor tools, we analyzed the spatial transcriptomic data and identified TLS-like regions enriched in various adaptive immune cell types. Integration of single-cell T cell phenotypes with spatial transcriptomic profiles further revealed distinct localisation patterns of T cell subtypes in relation to TLS, suggesting different TLS-related immune functions.
To further characterize immune dynamics, we performed adaptive immune receptor repertoire analysis and investigated the clonal relationships and expansion patterns of different T cell subsets. Notably, cytotoxic T cells showed sustained clonal expansion, yet limited overlap in clonal families across different phenotypic subsets was observed.
Together our work demonstrates how R/Bioconductor-powered analysis pipelines can dissect complex immune dynamics in glioma, providing insights in the role and spatial organization of T cell subtypes in the glioma immune microenvironment.",Anchang@med.uni-frankfurt.de,,,,,
Wed,Poster,,,Benchmark of statistical methods for differential expression analysis of bulk RNA-seq data using semi-synthetic data,,,,,,,,,,,,,Quentin Laval,,,,,"Transforming counts from bulk RNA-seq data into meaningful biological insights requires a robust statistical method. This study echoes concerns raised by Li et al. [1] about inflated false positives in RNA-seq differential expression analyses when analyzing large population samples. In a published correspondence [2], we highlighted a caveat in their simulation framework, where data were not actually generated under the null hypothesis, leading to biased conclusions. To provide a more accurate comparison, we reproduce and correct these simulations using the same semi-synthetic GTEx data. We benchmark four methods – dearseq [3], voom-limma [4], edgeR and DESeq2 - and assess their performance in terms of false discovery rate (FDR) control and statistical power. Dearseq and voom-limma consistently offer the best balance between sensitivity and FDR control, regardless of sample size, justifying their use in large-scale clinical transcriptomic studies. Additional results are informing the method choice for DEA according to the available sample-size and the needed precision on smallest p-values.

Thu,Poster,,,SPICEY: An R package for assessing tissue specificity from single cell multi-omics data,,,,,,,,,,,,,Georgina Fuentes-Páez,,,,,"Introduction
Pancreatic islets comprise diverse endocrine cell types critical for glucose homeostasis, with dysfunction leading to diabetes. Single-cell technologies have advanced the mapping of gene expression and chromatin accessibility, but systematic quantification of cell-type specificity for regulatory elements and genes remains challenging. Understanding cell-type-specific regulatory programs is essential for deciphering disease mechanisms, especially in complex tissues like pancreatic islets.

Methods
We developed SPICEY, an R package that integrates single-cell ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data to quantify cell-type specificity through two metrics: the Regulatory Element Tissue Specificity Index (RETSI) and Gene Expression Tissue Specificity Index (GETSI). These combine differential accessibility/expression with entropy-based measures to quantify specificity continuously. SPICEY further links distal regulatory elements to putative target genes through proximity or co-accessibility networks derived from scATAC-seq data, enabling joint analysis of tissue-specific enhancer-gene pairs.

Results
Applying SPICEY to single nucleus ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data from human pancreatic islets (Human Pancreas Analysis Program, HPAP), we quantified cell-type specificity across major islet populations including alpha, beta, and delta cells. RETSI and GETSI reliably distinguished endocrine from exocrine and stromal cells. Tissue-specific regulatory elements and genes exhibited significantly higher specificity indices and lower entropy than ubiquitous features. Integration of RETSI and GETSI via co-accessibility links revealed coordinated enhancer-gene regulatory programs underpinning cell identity. These results demonstrate the ability of SPICEY to capture biologically meaningful cell-type specificity in complex tissues.

Conclusions
SPICEY provides a robust and user-friendly framework to quantify and visualize cell-type-specific regulatory and transcriptional programs from single-cell multi-omics data. By integrating chromatin accessibility and gene expression, SPICEY advances the systematic characterization of regulatory mechanisms in heterogeneous tissues and supports interpretation of disease-relevant cellular heterogeneity, with implications for complex diseases and beyond.",georgina.fuentes@upf.edu,,,,,
Wed,Poster,,,"Analycyte, a GUI for automated post-clustering analyses of cytometry data",,,,,,,,,,,,,Eugénie Lohmann,,,,,"Cytometry is now able to measure a panel of several dozen markers on each cell in experiments involving a few dozen or a few hundred samples of around a million cells. Analysis of such a large volume of data requires the cells to be grouped into populations using unsupervised (FlowSOM or Phenograph clustering, for example), supervised (manual gating) or hybrid methods. These methods enable the cells in each sample to be mapped and the abundance and median intensity of each marker to be quantified in each cluster. Abundances and median intensities are crucial for comparing different experimental or clinical conditions and identifying clusters with significant variations. However, the methods currently available for this identification are often limited, not very automated and therefore time-consuming.

In order to move quickly from clusters to a list of candidates, we developed analycyte, a graphical and interactive web application for generating automated, standardised and configurable reports. analycyte identifies variations in abundance and marker intensity by comparing two or more conditions and graphically representing these variations and their p-value. Through an exploratory analysis (quality control), analycyte facilitates the detection of batch effects or samples (or markers) exhibiting atypical behaviour. analycyte supports data exported from OMIQ and FlowJo.

analycyte enables experimenters and platforms to quickly obtain relevant post-clustering analyses that can be easily shared with collaborators, simplifying their work and enabling them to carry out in-depth analyses. analycyte is available as R packages at https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/eugenie.lohmann/analycyte or as a Docker image.

Despite its extensive functionality, the deployment and reproducibility of these tools can remain challenging. This is a reflection of a broader issue in bioinformatics, where sharing code in a reusable and reproducible way is essential for advancing science. However, achieving portability and scalability continues to present technical obstacles. 
To address these challenges, workflow management systems like Nextflow are widely used.  Nextflow facilitates the development of portable, reproducible, and scalable data analysis pipelines whose standards are defined and maintained by the nf-core community. nf-core is a community that curates a collection of best-practice pipelines written in Nextflow. By adhering to nf-core standards, developers benefit from automated testing, continuous updates, compatibility across multiple computational environments, and community-driven enhancements. nf-core also provides a repository of modular reusable components (modules and subworkflows) and a dedicated command-line package to support the development and execution of pipelines.
Importantly, several nf-core pipelines rely on Bioconductor packages, creating a powerful synergy. This integration enables robust workflows that combine the tools from Bioconductor with the advantages of nf-core pipelines.
In this work, we explore the current landscape of Bioconductor and nf-core integration. We showcase practical examples of how Bioconductor packages can be incorporated into nf-core pipelines and highlight the benefits of doing so.
By connecting these two active communities, we aim to foster collaboration, exploit complementary strengths, and advance the development of accurate, reproducible, and scalable solutions for biological data analysis.

Thu,Poster,,,Benchmarking CNV-Based Approaches for Tumor Cell Classification Using Matched Single-Cell Genomic and Transcriptomic Data ,,,,,,,,,,,,,Nicolò Gnoato,,,,,"In single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses of cancer samples, distinguishing tumor cells from normal cells is a critical yet challenging task—one that is often underestimated or insufficiently addressed in many studies. Many existing methods rely on marker genes or machine learning models based on a reference expression set. However, these approaches face major limitations when applied to cancer datasets: the identification of robust, stable and cancer-specific markers is complicated by the high inter and intra-tumoral variability, while ML models often suffer from biases due to limited or poorly annotated training data. In fact, cancers are generally highly heterogeneous diseases, that can also vary significantly between patients but even among cells of the same tumor mass.
Although tumor cells can sometimes be mistaken for normal cells at the transcriptomic level—since they often reactivate pathways typical of normal cells —from a genomic perspective, they exhibit highly rearranged DNA that clearly distinguishes them from healthy cells.
The large-scale genomic rearrangements, which can lead to aberrant gene expression and disruption of key cellular processes can be captured by genomic Copy Number Variations (CNVs). Recently several tools attempt the inference of CNV from the scRNA-seq data. Thus, to overcome tumor cell detection challenge in single-cell RNAseq data, cancer-specific genome rearrangements can be used. Different CNV detection tools vary in performance, and this can impact also the tumor cell detection thus accurately characterizing CNVs is essential for identifying cancer cells in scRNA-seq data. While CNV inference methods have been benchmarked (refs here), their use for tumor cell detection has not been systematically reviewed.
In this study, we assess the accuracy of CNV inference and tumor cell detection by testing multiple tools across diverse datasets, including matched WGS and scRNA-seq data, synthetic mixtures with known proportions of normal cells, and samples with both scWGS and scRNA-seq. Our results provide a critical evaluation of current methods, highlighting their strengths and limitations, and offering practical guidelines for their use in cancer research.",nicolo.gnoato@phd.unipd.it,,,,,

Thu,Poster,,,Bioconductor packages to gene expression signature development in oncology,,,,,,,,,,,,,Irene Agustí Barea,,,,,"Gene expression signatures in cancer represent specific patterns of gene activity that can have a prognostic or predictive significance. Developing a gene signature using RNA-seq data involves several key steps: identification of candidate genes, quantification of signature scores and validation of their predictive or prognostic value; often involving multiple Bioconductor packages.
To identify relevant genes, the standard approach is to perform a differential expression analysis using tools such as limma/voom, edgeR or DESeq2 . The activity of the selected signature genes can then be quantified using several scoring methods. Unsupervised techniques like PCA can be used to define scores based on the first principal component using the selected genes. However, these results often highly depend on the cohort analyzed. To address these limitations, single-sample methods have been developed, such as GSVA or singscore, which uses rank-based statistics to provide more robust and reproducible quantification. 
In clinical contexts, it is essential to validate the prognostic performance of a gene signature using survival data. Packages like SigCheck facilitate this processing by enabling comparisons between the survival outcomes associated with the gene signature and those from random or previously established signatures.
Here, we have developed a gene expression signature to predict response to an alternative therapy to standard hormonal treatment on Estrogen Receptor-positive breast cancer using RNA-seq data obtained from patient-derived xenograft models (PDX).

Their genomic characterization is essential for elucidating the molecular mechanisms associated to cancer development and progression and response to treatment. Moreover, visualization of potentially relevant genomic alterations identified in multiple tumor samples, also known as oncoplot, provides an overview of the cohort, which is very useful for exploratory analysis.
Here we present a pipeline to create an oncoplot starting with whole exome sequencing (WES) data of a set of PDX samples, involving multiple steps that use diverse tools written in diverse programming languages. The first steps of quality control and filtering of mouse reads are performed using the command-line tools FastQC, fastp and BBSplit, each of them encapsulated into Singularity containers. The alignment and variant calling are performed with nf-core/sarek pipeline, which uses BWA-mem to align reads on the genome, Mutect2 to call somatic SNPs and short indels, and SnpEff to annotate the variants.

Furthermore, EDAM is a key component for the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR principles) within ELIXIR resources, including the ELIXIR Research Software Ecosystem (RSEc) (Ienasescu et al. 2023) and the bio.tools registry (Ison et al., 2019). bio.tools holds a collection of more than 30,000 entries, curated and annotated using EDAM terms, and provides enhanced search capacities through an API for easy programmatic access to the database. In order to increase the visibility and interoperability of Bioconductor packages, as well as the coverage and validity of Bioconductor in the RSEc, we aim to use the EDAM ontology to describe Bioconductor package metadata, and to automate their integration into the bio.tools registry.  Our first results towards these objectives include mapping the biocViews vocabulary to EDAM, initiating the curation of a reference set of packages with manual annotations to be used as a gold standard, integrating Bioconductor metadata into the RSEc with automated updates, and prototyping a tool for automated EDAM term suggestions.  Together, these achievements establish a strong foundation for further integration and refinement of Bioconductor package descriptions. It will also consequently improve their integration within the Galaxy toolshed through the bio.tools registry of software. Beyond advancing the FAIRification of resources for life science research, this initiative builds a collaborative bridge between the Bioconductor, ELIXIR and Galaxy communities.",claire.rioualen@france-bioinformatique.fr,No,,,,

We are developing a tool capable of integrating and visualizing multi-omics data in an efficient and compelling manner, facilitating the exploration of relationships between different biological features and their multiple layers, such as genes, proteins, and metabolites. The goal is to allow the user to easily perform a drill down analysis on multiple omics layers at the same time, with a focus on an easy and effective interpretation of results that often encompass multiple contrasts. This tool will also interface to different integration methods (e.g. MOFA, moClusters), and additionally enable the integration of results at the level of features and pathways.

Most of the standard approaches for omics data modeling rely on the comparison of just one data type among different groups of samples. Since the different omics are biologically related, it is fundamental to statistically detect their interplay. In order to do that we need statistical models that take into account all the omics, trying to detect the key molecular players involved. To solve this need, in this work we provide an easy to use R package for omics data integration.  gINTomics is designed to detect the association between the expression of a target and of its regulators while taking into account their genomics modifications such as Copy Number Variations and methylation.  For RNA sequencing data, the counts will be fitted using a negative binomial model, while in the case of microarray or other types of data, a linear model will be applied. The gINTomics visualizer allows the visualization of the results for all the integrations performed. It is divided into four sections: Genomic Integration for the results regarding copy number variations and methylation; Transcription Integration for those regarding transcriptional networks (Transcription Factors and miRNA); Class Comparison for highlighting differences among classes defined by the user; Complete Integration for a comprehensive table with all the available results and a Circos plot for the visualization of different integrations. We are currently working on the development of new workflows to exploit gINTomics’ integration with single cell and spatial transcriptomics data through the generation of pseudo-bulk data, moreover we are developing new functions to integrate the omics at the single cell level.

A total of 4,230 genes were found to be simultaneously regulated by both mechanisms, including SCYL3, FGR, and GCLC, which are involved in tumor progression and drug resistance. Key transcription factors such as TAL1, FOXP3, and GATA1 were identified, influencing the tumor microenvironment and immune response. The comparison between short- and long-term survivors highlighted molecular differences, with oncogenes amplified in poor prognosis cases and tumor suppressors lost.

While the author indicated a plan to submit a package, this abstract is relatively short and doesn’t provide clear details about the package or the methods. In this case, I suggest a poster format; **Clarity**: It is well-written. No problem there.**Originality**:  It represents a possible advancement in developing new biomarkers for DLB vs AD differentiation, if new markers have been identified (which appears to be the case, given that there are 63 metabolites). Several studies have done this before. I did find one study that actually looks at APOE in the patient cohort, uses LC-MS, and achieves an AUC >0.97 using an orbitrap LC-MS, albeit with less interesting statistical methods. **Given the number of metabolite identified, I am certain that the putative biomarkers this study found will be novel leads.** This is assuredly not the first study to look at this problem, but it is an important question to continue study.**Significance**: The ability to discover the correct diagnosis for a patient is incredibly important and saves lives for those with DLB. ""DLB is under-diagnosed across populations"" https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38277299/ Earlier diagnosis and treatment could improve life expectancy and quality of life.**Quality**: This doesn't really represent a major methodological advance, nor will it have a broad scientific audience amongst the conference.

I would advocate that he be given priority consideration for financial aid, though I am unsure how much we will have this year. I imagine the small amount we could contribute to a train could really make a difference, if we have funds for it.**Recommendation**: This doesn't seem like an amazing talk, but probably a poster would be suitable. Detail on studies I reviewed: There was a study of plasma metabolite signatures done in 2024 between DLB and AD that was already able to be quite accurate: ""Our finding that a combination of glutamine and lysoPC a C24:0 distinguished DLB from AD with 92% accuracy supports the concept that metabolomic analysis could be translated to the clinic."" Source:https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10794326/. This study used a panel of 630 metabolites instead of LC-MS, so an LC-MS method should incorporate many new metabolites.There was another study that used lipidomics with LC-MS in 2024(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39407312/). Lipidomic-MS should reveal larger weight biomarkers than this study, but this LC-MS metabolomics study should reveal many metabolites that the lipidomics LC-MS study could not.Finally, there was another metabolomic study done three years ago that used a very small metabolite panel to distinguish DLB from AD, but this study uses LC-MS, which should reveal many more novel metabolites than this older, cheaper method. They used really simple statistical methods and did not develop their own software to do it, but the AUC>0.97 leads me to believe that an effective panel has already been developed in differentiating the two diagnoses. https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9545206/; In this abstract, the authors report about a project on biomarker identification for alzheimer and dementia.

Wed,Poster,,,svdImpute2: An enhanced SVD-based imputation of randomly and non-randomly missing values in proteomics data,SponsorPoster,,,,,,,,,,,,"Antonino Zito, Ivo Kwee",Bigomics Analytics,male,,,"-Introduction- Missing values (MVs) reduce the completeness of biological datasets. Compared to other
omics, proteomic data are more severely affected by MVs. Values can miss at random
(MAR) or not at random (MNAR). Both MAR and MNAR data points impact key data
processing steps, including batch effect correction, clustering, and differential expression
tests. Ultimately, MVs reduce discovery power. Removing MVs allow to achieve a fully
complete dataset, but at the cost of losing potentially valuable information. Ideally, MVs
should be accurately recovered, i.e., ”imputed”. How MVs emerge in proteomics is not
well understood. Likewise, it is still unclear what are the best methods and stages for MVs
recovery.
-Methods- To contribute to addressing these questions, we undertook a combinatorial approach. We
used public proteomic datasets to: 1) perform comparison with RNA-seq data; 2) assess
the type of MVs; 3) injected MVs in complete real data and performed comparison
between distinct imputation algorithms. To this end, we employed R meta-packages,
including MSnbase, pcaMethods and NAguideR to conveniently integrate single-value,
global-structure and local-similarity-based imputation methods. Tested methods included
SVD, LLS, BPCA, MsImpute, RF, KNN, QRILC, MLE, MinDet, MinProb; 4) improve the
existing SVD-based imputation to achieve an enhanced algorithm exhibiting superior
performance. -Preliminary data- Comparison between RNA-seq vs. proteomic data revealed substantially different data
distribution. While RNA-seq data typically follow a negative binomial distribution
populating the 0-15 range of values (log2), proteomic intensities may range from minimum
detected intensity of 20 to 40 (log2). Proteomic data may harbor a gap between 0 and
minimum detected intensity. These undetected features -peptides or proteins- are
reported as “NA” (MVs) rather than zero. Owing to this distribution gap, reporting MVs as
zero would skew fold-changes and other statistical measures for low intensities.
Next, we assessed and compared the performance of distinct imputation algorithms. We
injected MAR and MNAR MVs in complete real data and performed imputation. This
approach allowed us to compare imputed points against the original (complete) values.
We observed that both matrix factorization (SVD, NMF) or regression-based methods
(RF, LLS, MLE) can model MAR and MNAR MVs. This would challenge previous reports of model-based methods as only applicable to MARs. Overall, variable behavior is
observed across methods.
RF and BPCA were often the best in terms of accuracy and error, but also among the
slowest methods. Interestingly, svdImpute() provided good balance in terms of accuracy,
robustness and computational efficiency. It is also capable of imputing both MAR and
MNAR MVs, scaling well to large sample sizes. Thus, we aimed to further improve the
current svdImpute().
In svdImpute() the MVs are set to zero at the first iteration. PCA is often performed on the
covariance matrix that has zero mean, however, imputation should not be expected to
have zero mean. This might contribute to a reduced performance of svdImpute(). To
address this problem, we modified the way svdImpute handles MVs at the first iteration.
We also added irlba(). Altogether, our modified algorithm version, “svdImpute2”, exhibited
a 40% improved computation speed when compared to svd() or prcomp().
Novel aspect
svdImpute2() is more robust, and exhibits reduced error rate and runtime than
svdImpute(). It scales very well on large datasets.

It is highly relevant, particularly for those working with NGS in clinical or research settings, and its potential for precision medicine makes it a valuable addition to the Bioconductor ecosystem.; The abstract presents an R/Bioconductor package for detecting specific rare and under-explored chromosomal abnormalities. The package incorporates statistical methods and might offer additional value for both biological researchers and method developers. Even though the author submitted this work as a poster, the topic appears well suited for a short talk given its clinical relevance; In this work, the authors present a Bioconductor package UPDhmm, which uses hidden markov models to identify uniparental disomies (UPDs) in NGS data of children and their parents. The package was tested on both simulated as well as real world data and seemed to outperfom existing methods.",poster,,,"Poster;Short talk;Short talk,Poster",3,2,"Marta Sevilla Porras,Luis Pérez Jurado,Carlos Ruiz-Arenas",CIBERER,female,Genetics/genomics,rare diseases,"Uniparental disomies (UPDs) are rare chromosomal abnormalities in which an individual inherits both copies of a chromosome, or a segment thereof, from a single parent. This genetic anomaly can contribute to disease through recessive mutations or disruptions in genomic imprinting. Despite their clinical relevance, UPDs remain underexplored due to limitations in current detection methods applied to next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. We introduce UPDhmm, a novel bioinformatics tool designed to detect UPD events using NGS data from trios (proband and both parents). By employing a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to distinguish standard Mendelian inheritance from UPD patterns, UPDhmm enables the accurate identification, classification, and localization of UPD events. Benchmark evaluations using simulated data from both exome and whole-genome sequencing datasets demonstrated that UPDhmm outperforms existing tools, such as UPDio and AltAFplotter, particularly in detecting smaller UPD events while minimizing false positives and accurately classifying UPD subtypes (isodisomy and heterodisomy). A key advantage of UPDhmm is its ability to model both Mendelian inheritance and UPD patterns with enhanced sensitivity, particularly in consanguineous datasets where runs of homozygosity (ROH) can confound detection. By reducing reliance on ROH, UPDhmm provides more accurate results. Its capacity to analyze both exome and whole-genome sequencing data makes it highly applicable in clinical contexts. Additionally, UPDhmm precisely identifies the genomic coordinates of UPD events, a critical feature often lacking in alternative methods. UPDhmm’s efficiency was further validated through its application to real datasets, including data from the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC), a large autism spectrum disorder (ASD) cohort. Two notable UPD events exceeding 10 Mb were exclusively detected in affected children. One case revealed a paternal isodisomy on chromosome 8, overlapping genes CHD7 and VPS13B, both linked to neurodevelopmental disorders. Another case identified a maternal heterodisomy on chromosome 22, involving the ASD-related gene SHANK3 and several imprinted genes. These findings highlight UPDhmm’s potential for discovering clinically relevant UPD events. UPDhmm is available as an R/Bioconductor package, providing accessibility for researchers and clinicians working with NGS datasets. Its performance on both simulated and real datasets underscores its value for uncovering rare genetic variations with clinical significance in undiagnosed rare disease patients, making it a powerful tool for research and diagnostics.",marta.sevilla@upf.edu,No,,,,

Scaling up this experimental approach is the central tool of the DECODE project, founded with the aim of systematically mapping context-dependent genetic networks across dynamic tissues in vivo. Drosophila melanogaster serves as our model system, in which we specifically perturb only cells expressing intestinal stem cell markers. By integrating single-cell transcriptomics and high-resolution imaging of thousands of conditional knockouts, DECODE aims to resolve how genetic networks dynamically adapt their topology across cell types and external stimuli. To achieve organism-scale profiling, we utilize single-cell combinatorial indexing RNA sequencing (sci-RNA-seq), a split-pool barcoding strategy that exponentially scales throughput while reducing costs to ~1 cent per cell. With the transition from whole-cell to single-nucleus profiling, this method is able to avoid challenges in cell dissociation and minimize tissue-specific biases. Even though nuclear RNA lacks cytoplasmic transcripts, nuclei isolation enables universal application across tissues, including RNase-rich adult samples, and reduces dissociation-induced stress artifacts compared to scRNA-seq. Despite the mentioned loss of cytoplasmic transcripts, snRNA-seq retains sufficient biological signal to characterize population heterogeneity and often achieves a higher signal-to-noise ratio by avoiding sequencing of abundant mitochondrial and ribosomal transcripts. A careful optimization of sci-RNA-seq is required to mitigate artifacts like index hopping and ensure high-quality data. QC metrics such as UMI counts, gene detection, and duplication rates are lower compared to droplet-based methods but are sufficient for robust population characterization when improved. Indeed, a recent optimization to sci-RNA-seq (sci-RNA-seq3) has enhanced sensitivity. Understanding the challenges and limitations of sci-RNA-seq remains an active area of investigation and, through this work, we aim to further evaluate its performance and benchmark it against gold-standard methods.",sara.baldinelli@embl.de,No,,,,

However, these models are not a perfect reflection of human disease, and selecting a suitable model can be challenging. Existing computational approaches for molecular validation of pathophysiological resemblance to human conditions at single-cell resolution remain limited. Although quantitative computational methods exist to inform this selection, they are very limited at the single-cell resolution, which can be critical for model selection. Quantifying the resemblance of disease models to the human condition with single-cell technologies in an explainable, integrative, and generalizable manner remains a significant challenge.  Results: We present singIST, a computational method for comparative single-cell transcriptomics analysis between disease models and human conditions. singIST provides explainable quantitative measures on disease model similarity to human condition at both pathway and cell type levels, highlighting the importance of each gene in the latter. These measures account for orthology, cell type presence in the disease model, cell type and gene importance in human condition, and gene changes in the disease model measured as fold change. This is achieved within a unifying framework that controls for the intrinsic complexities of single-cell data. We tested our method using three well-characterized murine models of moderate-to-severe Atopic Dermatitis, demonstrating its ability to recapitulate established biological knowledge while generating novel hypothesis through pathway-level analysis.

They actively process biological information, sensing and responding to both internal and external cues. Through complex physical interactions and diffusion mechanisms within cellular networks, mitochondria integrate diverse signals to finely modulate cellular functions and overall physiology. Consequently, impairments in mitochondrial function can result in a wide spectrum of phenotypic manifestations. High-throughput transcriptomic technologies are capable of capturing these mitochondrial-related changes. However, conventional pathway analysis tools based on general-purpose databases often fall short in detecting specific mitochondrial alterations. This limitation is largely due to the broad nature of pathways, where mitochondrial components typically represent only a minor fraction of the overall signaling cascades. To address this gap, we developed mitology, an R package specifically designed for the analysis of mitochondrial activity through transcriptomic data. We began by compiling a comprehensive list of genes encoding proteins localized to mitochondria, drawing from specialized resources such as MitoCarta3.0, IMPI, MSeqDR, and Gene Ontology entries with terms including “mitochondri-” word. Building on this curated gene set, mitology offers ready-to-use implementations of MitoCarta3.0 pathways and introduces a restructured view of general pathway databases like Reactome and Gene Ontology, reorganized to highlight mitochondrial-related processes. These mitochondria-focused gene sets serve as the foundation for pathway analysis, enabling single-sample evaluations that are both targeted and sensitive to mitochondrial signals. Additionally, mitology is compatible with a range of transcriptomic data types - from classical bulk RNA-seq to cutting-edge single-cell and spatial transcriptomics - allowing researchers to explore mitochondrial dynamics across diverse biological contexts.

Single-cell data, however, is complex, incomplete and noisy. There are technical and technological limitations affecting our view of each individual cell, such as limited sequencing capacity, failure to completely isolate individual cells prior to their analysis. Most of the technical noise and limitations and identified and managed through the extensive quality control steps often included in single-cell transcriptomics data analysis pipelines. This data is also affected by true biological variation in cell states, variation that reflects true biological differences in cellular state and identity. One example of such variation is the cell cycle, which might affect the global transcriptional profile of a cell and strongly impact our analysis. There are multiple approaches for the identification of cycling cells, but their management depends on the aims of our analyses, since their analysis will inform on the state of the original tissue but will limit our capacity to identify more subtle expression changes. Another source of cellular gene expression variation is cellular stress. This is an important source of variation because it might represent the state of the original tissue or might be the result of sample management in their long path from tissue resection to analysis, forcing us to detect it and take it into account in our analysis.  For this, we developed scYoga, an R package for the identification of cellular stress in single-cell transcriptomics data. The core functionality of the package is based on the detection of the combined overexpression of sets of genes associated with the different cellular stresses.

Menzies Institute for Medical Research, University of Tasmania, Hobart, TAS  Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a complex, chronic autoimmune, neurodegenerative, central nervous system disease influenced by genetics. Around half the risk of developing MS is due to genetics, and large case-control studies have accounted for part of this risk through common genetic variation but have been limited in their ability to identify rare genetic variants associated with MS. Approximately 10-15% of people with MS report a family history. While infrequent, rare multi-case MS families do occur. Genome sequencing in multi-case MS families is ideal for identifying rare variants that may be associated with MS risk in a family. We hypothesised that rare, likely deleterious, genetic variants segregating with MS contribute to the higher incidence of MS in six multi-case families. To identify these variants and genes that may contribute to MS in these families we combined variants prioritised from genome sequence data with Bioconductor packages. Genome sequence data was analysed with the SAREK nextflow pipeline, along with ‘bcftools’, ‘GATK’, and ‘R’. The resulting variant calls were annotated and filtered to identified rare, likely deleterious variants that segregated with MS in each family. Bioconductor packages and webtools including ‘enrichViewNet’, ‘goseq’, ‘STRING’, and ‘genemenia’ were used to analyse the resulting gene lists from each family to identify overrepresented biological pathways across families. Within each family, the number of variants prioritised for further analysis ranged from nine to 224. The number of variants depended on the size of the family studied. Across all six families, a total of 712 variants in 680 genes were identified. Narrowing down which specific variants may increase the risk for MS among the identified variants is challenging. At the gene level compelling candidates were identified in each family, with known biology supporting a putative role in MS. There was also an overlap at the gene level across families with variants in 21 genes found in two or more families. Using these gene list we first examined genes with protein coding  variants. We used Bioconductor packages to identify overlapping biological pathways in these gene lists across families. An overrepresentation of genes with rare, likely deleterious variants was identified in the following three gene ontology (GO) molecular function terms: cytoskeletal protein binding (GO:0008092, P=0.00157), microfilament motor activity (GO:0000146, P=0.0162), actin binding (GO:0003779, P = 0.010526). The analysis was then extended to include genes that had non-coding variants. Non-coding variants may also contribute to disease risk but may be more difficult to initially predict their functional effect.  This increased the number of overrepresented GO terms identified to 90 GO terms as well as identifying terms in phenotype and pathway ontologies.  This included neurogenesis (GO:0022008, P = 6.205e-08), somatodendritic compartment (GO:0036477, P=2.81e-04), cytoskeletal protein binding (GO:0008092, P=5.99e-04), and spinal dysraphism (HP:0010301  , P=2.65e-02). Through the application of Bioconductor packages this analysis has identified evidence that suggests genes involved in pathways relevant to neuronal function are involved in MS risk.

Meanwhile, image processing is becoming an integral part of analyzing spatial data readouts where image registration and alignment of tissue sections is essential for accurate spatially aware data integration. Hence, there is a need for computational platforms that process and analyze images of microanatomical tissue structures as well as those that integrate datasets across distinct spatial resolutions and microscopy images. To this end, we have developed VoltRon, an R package for end-to-end spatial omics analysis with comprehensive image processing capabilities and a novel spatial data framework that supports a large selection of distinct spatial resolutions. To connect and integrate spatial multi-omic profiles across adjacent/serial tissue sections, VoltRon incorporates scalable computer vision workflows for automated synchronization of spatial coordinates and images. VoltRon accounts for spatial organization of tissue blocks (samples), layers (sections) and assays given a multi-resolution and agnostic collection of spatial data readouts. Our tool offers a unique data structure that accommodates data readouts with many levels of spatial resolutions (i.e., multi-resolution). These include spots, single cells, and molecules as well as regions of interest (ROIs) and even image tiles/pixels that are often ignored in currently available spatial omic analysis platforms. Hence, VoltRon (i) is capable of bulk-like analysis of ROI-based spatial datasets, (ii) paves the way for pixel-level analysis of images and (iii) provides downstream analysis of spatially-resolved subcellular observations. VoltRon performs information transfer across tissue sections and multiple modalities which we demonstrate by integrating the pathology driven analysis onto spatially localised SARS-CoV-2 viral RNAs within infected lung tissue using image co-registration of histological images.

This process is critical for uncovering biological differences between conditions, such as disease versus healthy states. In proteomics, several statistical methods have been used, ranging from simple t-tests to more sophisticated methods like limma and ROTS.  -Results- In this study, we developed LimROTS, a hybrid method integrating the linear model and the empirical Bayes method from the limma framework with Reproducibility-Optimized Statistics from ROTS, by introducing a novel moderated ranking statistic, for robust and flexible analysis of proteomics data. We validated its performance using twenty-one proteomics gold standard spike-in datasets with different protein mixtures, MS instruments, and techniques for benchmarking. This hybrid approach improves accuracy and reproducibility in proteomics. Additionally, it could be potentially applicable to other omics such as transcriptomics and metabolomics, making LimROTS a powerful tool for high-dimensional omics data analysis. -Availability and Implementation- LimROTS has been implemented as an R/Bioconductor, available at  https://bioconductor.org/packages/LimROTS/.",aymost@utu.fi,No,,,,

We use clustering and marker gene expression to annotate cell-types. We annotate perturbed cells using a reference-based k-nearest neighbors classifier. We examine differential gene expression via pseudo-bulk DESeq2 analysis, and evaluate changes in cell-type proportions via compositional analysis. We use lineage inference to identify transcription factors involved in differentiation. Gene set enrichment analysis will help identify pathways associated with ISC differentiation.

However, existing computational tools often focus on specific analytical steps (e.g., interaction calling or differential analysis), lacking the flexibility to support comprehensive data handling workflows tailored to the structure of capture-based protocols. While Bioconductor packages like GenomicInteractions provide useful infrastructure for chromatin contact data, they are not optimized for CHi-C pipelines. Conversely, specialized tools such as CHiCAGO and Chicdiff offer focused statistical frameworks but limited support for integration or downstream analysis.  To fill this gap, we present HiCaptuRe, a Bioconductor-compatible R package for streamlined processing, standardization, and integration of Capture Hi-C and related interaction datasets. Designed with capture-specific workflows in mind, HiCaptuRe distinguishes between baited and non-baited fragments and supports multiple input formats — including native CHiCAGO outputs, BEDPE, and track files for genome browsers — allowing flexibility across a range of interaction capture technologies (e.g., HiChIP, PCHi-C[1], liCHi-C[2]).  HiCaptuRe’s preprocessing module resolves duplicated interactions, enforces consistent formatting, and stores results in a structured HiCaptuRe object. This object maintains interaction data alongside detailed metadata, ensuring transparency and reproducibility throughout the analysis pipeline.  The package enables integrative analysis through two complementary approaches:  - interactionsByBaits supports bait-centered workflows (e.g., gene promoter CHi-C), facilitating integration with transcriptomic data such as RNA-seq. - interactionsByRegions allows region-centered exploration, particularly suited for linking interaction data with epigenomic profiles (e.g., ATAC-seq, CUT&RUN).  These dual strategies enable both hypothesis-driven and exploratory multi-omics analyses, making HiCaptuRe a valuable tool for researchers studying transcriptional regulation and non-coding genome function.  HiCaptuRe also offers functionality for comparative analysis, enabling users to identify condition-specific chromatin contacts — a critical feature for dissecting dynamic processes like cellular differentiation or disease progression.  To ensure scalability, HiCaptuRe integrates data.table-based data handling and includes caching mechanisms to improve runtime performance. The package’s modular design makes it easily extensible and adaptable to custom workflows within the Bioconductor ecosystem.  To broaden accessibility, a Shiny web application is in development, designed for non-programming users. This graphical interface allows wet-lab scientists to upload, explore, and analyze CHi-C datasets without writing code, bridging the gap between data generation and biological interpretation.  In summary, HiCaptuRe complements the Bioconductor suite by offering a capture-aware, integration-ready, and user-friendly solution for analyzing chromatin interaction data. By combining preprocessing, standardization, and multi-omics integration within a coherent R framework, HiCaptuRe facilitates deeper insights into 3D genome organization and its role in gene regulation and disease. The package is open-source, actively developed, and open to community contributions and suggestions. HiCaptuRe is currently being prepared for official submission to Bioconductor, where it will continue to evolve as part of the collaborative, reproducibility-focused ecosystem supporting genomic data analysis in R.

In particular, development by a single researcher can easily result in orphaned and dysfunctional software packages, especially if combined with poor documentation, missing unit tests or lack of adherence to open software development standards. The RforMassSpectrometry (https://www.rformassspectrometry.org/) initiative aims to develop an efficient, scalable, and stable infrastructure for mass spectrometry (MS) based proteomics and metabolomics data analysis. As part of this initiative, a growing ecosystem of R software packages is being developed covering different aspects of metabolomics and proteomics data analysis. To avoid the aforementioned problems, community contributions are fostered, and open development, documentation and long-term support emphasised.  At the heart of the package ecosystem lies the *Spectra* package that provides the core infrastructure to handle, process and visualise MS data. Its design allows easy expansion to support existing and new file or data formats, including data representations with minimal memory footprint or remote data access. For proteomics data analysis, two packages in particular are dedicated to the analysis or quantitative and identification data. The *PSMatch* package handles and manages peptide identification data. It also provides functions to model and visualise peptide-protein relations to make informed decision about shared peptide filtering. The package also provides functions to calculate and visualise MS2 fragment ions, in conjunction with the *Spectra* package. The *QFeatures* package is the working horse for quantitative proteomics data. It builds on the familiar *SummarizedExperiment* and *MultiAssayExperiment* infrastructure and provides a familiar Bioconductor user experience to manage bulk and single-cell quantitative data across different assay levels (such as peptide spectrum matches, peptides and proteins) in a coherent and tractable way.  For metabolomics data analysis, *xcms* is one of the core software packages for the required preprocessing of LC-MS data. This Bioconductor package was recently updated to reuse the R for Mass Spectrometry infrastructure, enabling now also the analysis of very large, and/or remote, data. This integration simplifies in addition complete analysis workflows which can include functionality from the *MsFeatures* package for compounding, and from the *MetaboAnnotation* package facilitating annotation of untargeted metabolomics experiments. Public annotation resources can be easily accessed through packages such as *MsBackendMassbank*, *MsBackendMsp* or *CompoundDb*, the latter also allowing to create and manage lab-specific compound databases.  These packages rely on the *MsCoreUtils* and *MetaboCoreUtils* packages for efficient implementations of commonly used algorithms, designed to be re-used by other R packages.  In contrast to a monolithic software design, the R for Mass Spectrometry ecosystem enables to build customised, modular, and reproducible analysis workflows. Future proteomics- and metabolomics-related development will focus on improved data structures and analysis methods, better support for third-party data import, and better interoperability with other open source software.",laurent.gatto@uclouvain.be,No,,,,

In this study, we compare three supervised machine learning algorithms, Lasso-regularized Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Random Forests (RF), and Fuzzy Forests (FF), to classify IHD from healthy controls, using gut microbiome profiles obtained from the Metacardis project (metacardis.net). The dataset included 375 patients with IHD and 275 healthy controls. Preprocessing included normalization, filtering of low-abundance taxa, and stratified train and test splitting. Model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), with FF outperforming RF and Lasso-GLM in models classifying IHD from healthy subjects (AUC = 0.83 vs. 0.74 and 0.71, respectively). The results from the FF algorithm are consistent with previously reported studies, which emphasize significant alterations in the abundance of various microbial taxa in IHD patients. Taxa such as Prevotella, Bacteroides, and Ruminococcus were among those exhibiting marked differences in abundance between IHD patients and healthy controls, suggesting their potential role in the disease's etiology as previously reported.

GWAS population studies have clearly implicated non-coding regulatory genomic regions in the development of cardiac hypertrophy, and a number of mechanistic investigations suggest a role for epigenetic mechanisms as well as DNA damage in mediating hypertrophy. However, the identity and activity of epigenomic regions deployed during this pathological process have not been studied in detail, in particular cell-type specific epigenetic changes. In this ongoing project, we aim to study the interplay between DNA damage and epigenomic dysregulation associated to the development of cardiac hypertrophy, using established in vivo and in vitro models.    Methods: We have applied a cardiac hypertrophy induction protocol to a transgenic mouse reporter model (⍺-MHC-mCherry), chronically treated with Angiotensin II (1µg/kg/min) (Ang-II) over 14 days. Induction of cardiac hypertrophy was measured by analysing heart weight, induction of hypertrophy-related gene markers, and cell size in histological sections. In this model, we performed: i) single-cell RNAseq and ii) epigenomic profiling of H3K27ac in mice cardiomyocytes (CM) and non-cardiomyocytes (non-CM) by ChIP sequencing, iii)  epigenomic profiling of H3K27ac in iPSC-CMs by CUT&Tag. As a complementary approach, we are employing an in vitro model in human iPSCs differentiated to cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CM) to study the impact of DNA damage modulation in the epigenome during cardiac hypertrophy, by using endothelin-I (ET-1) and pharmacological inhibition approaches. iPSC-CM cell size changes are evaluated by automated high-content microscopy and automated image analysis (ilastik + CellProfiler).   Results: Mice treated with Ang-II show a clear induction of hypertrophy-related gene markers as well as an increase in cell size. Single-cell RNAseq data shows a cell-type specific transcriptomic response to Ang-II. Consistently, differential binding analysis showed 766 differentially H3K27ac bound sites in CMs and 2061 in non-CMs, most of them closely related to cardiac hypertrophy biological processes as shown in Gene Ontology enrichment analysis. In vitro, treatment with ET-1 in iPSC-CM leads to a clear induction of hypertrophy-related gene markers as well as to an increase in cell size. We detected induction of DNA damage and, interestingly, pharmacological inhibition of ATM reverses CM hypertrophy induced by ET-1. Evaluation of H3K27ac changes observed during induction of cardiac hypertrophy by CUT&Tag are partially reversed after inhibition of ATM.   Conclusions: We have validated Angiotensin-II-infused mice and endothelin-I-treated iPSC-CMs for the study of cardiac hypertrophy at the molecular and cellular level. Induction of cardiac hypertrophy through Angiotensin-II induces broad (epi)genomic dysregulation in different cardiac cell types. Further ongoing epigenomic profiling in iPSC-CMs after modulation of DNA response will deliver novel insights on the role DNA damage in this pathology and the underlying epigenomic dysregulation.",d.fernandezaroca@qmul.ac.uk,"I'm a postdoctoral researcher based on the Blizard Institute (Queen Mary University of London, United Kingdom).

Correlation in their abundance suggests functional interdependence, offering insights into biological functions. Thus, identifying biologically meaningful protein groups (modules) is a critical step in understanding cellular processes. While many module detection methods exist, they were developed for bulk or transcriptomic data and rely on the assumption that gene expression levels can identify functionally related protein groups.  Single-cell proteomics (SCP) quantifies protein levels at single-cell resolution, eliminating this assumption and offering a more accurate view of functional protein relationships. Moreover, SCP preserves cellular heterogeneity, enabling the discovery of dynamic and context-specific protein modules are often masked in bulk measurements. Despite these advantages, existing module detection methods may not be well suited for SCP data, which presents unique challenges such as batch effects and missing values.  Moreover, these methods also differ by various features, for instance, whether they incorporate (or not) prior biological knowledge, whether they allow (or not) overlapping modules, or to what extent they use differential correlation analysis. Parameter choices further influence the identified modules, often leading to arbitrary decisions. However, all share a more critical limitation: they generate modules even when applied to random data. It is therefore essential to distinguish biologically relevant modules from artifacts.  In this work, we systematically evaluate module detection methods on SCP datasets. Our assessment framework integrates (1) internal clustering metrics to evaluate compactness and separation, (2) external validation against known biological annotations, and (3) network-based analyses incorporating protein-protein interaction data to enhance biological interpretability. Our findings reveal notable differences in the biological relevance of the identified modules and offer practical recommendations for selecting and validating module detection approaches for single-cell proteomics.

The methods are careful and well-written, but they did not articulate what exactly was new about what they were doing or what putative biological insights that are novel.Quality: It's a good paper, likely to be well written and thoughtfully carried out with a clear plan.  I really like the idea of using explainable AI... but they didn't say how it helped them achieve a scientific advance. Significance: If they made a model that was highly accurate with new taxa, that would be an advance because the new taxa would suggest an association with obesity. They probably did this, but just didn't articulate it well. The abstract makes it sound as though they found that existing taxa known to be already associated with obesity form a robust model, which isn't terribly new.Overall: this paper probably contains some new taxa and so it is probably novel.

Machine learning (ML) models are powerful tools for finding patterns in microbiome data, yet they often act as ""black boxes,"" making it hard to understand why certain predictions are made. In this study, we applied explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques using curatedMetagenomicData (via Bioconductor/R) from individuals with varying body mass index (BMI) to study the microbial drivers behind obesity predictions. To ensure reliable input for machine learning models, we applied several preprocessing steps. Rare taxa present in fewer than 10% of the samples were filtered out to minimize noise. To address the compositional nature of microbiome data, feature counts were transformed using centered log-ratio (CLR) transformation after the addition of a small pseudo-count. Samples with missing BMI values or incomplete metadata were excluded. This preprocessing pipeline helped standardize the data and reduce technical variability, ensuring that downstream machine learning models could focus on biologically relevant patterns. Several classification models such as random forests, gradient boosting, and predomics, were trained. We then used SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) to interpret the models’ outputs.

approach eliminates manual dependency resolution and ensures consistent execution
environments across pipelines, collaborators, and compute infrastructure.
We show how Nextflow pipelines use these containers in scalable, reproducible workflows.
Nextflow supports embedded R scripts as first-class workflow steps, and built-in container
support enables each R-based process to run reproducibly across HPC, cloud, or hybrid
systems.
To support interactive and exploratory analysis, we additionally provide ‘Studios’ through our
commercial offering ‘Seqera Platform’ (available with free academic licensing): fully reproducible

Early detection remains difficult, as most cases are diagnosed at an advanced stage owing to the lack of effective screening tools. This late diagnosis contributes to poor outcomes and complicates treatment strategies. A key factor in its severity is the extensive heterogeneity of both tumor cells and their surrounding microenvironment, combined with their intricate interplay.          The major bottleneck in understanding the interactions and mechanisms of tumor microenvironment (TME) cells lies in the accurate identification of specific cell types and subtypes. Despite advances in sequencing technologies, the lack of integrated multi-omics data—such as pairing single-cell transcriptomics with spatial transcriptomics—limits the accuracy of cell identification.     Accurate cell identification remains a challenge, especially due to limitations in current annotation methods. These include manual annotation offers expert insight but is slow and resource-intensive; reference-based tools like SingleR and CIBERSORTx automate the process but rely on complete, context-specific reference datasets, often lacking in cases like HGSOC, while marker-based methods allow targeted identification but suffer from reduced accuracy due to overlapping or variable marker expression.      Our HGSOC dataset consists of 17 single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) samples collected from different patients and anatomical sites, allowing us to explore the heterogeneity of cell composition in relation to metastatic location.     Following a comprehensive benchmarking of annotation tools, we selected the strategy that most effectively captured the extensive cellular diversity in our samples, emphasizing methods supported by strong and consistent evidence.      To distinguish tumour from normal cells, we first relied on copy number variation (CNV) profiles inferred from scRNA-seq data. Using an R package currently under development in our lab, we calculated CNV-based scores across the transcriptome, improving classification accuracy and confidence in identifying tumour versus non-tumour cells.     Next, we applied a curated panel of biomarkers tailored to the cellular landscape of HGSOC. Leveraging the *AUCell* package, we performed an initial classification of normal cells into stromal and immune compartments. Subsequently, we refined cell type annotation by manually selecting non-overlapping gene markers representative of key cell populations in the TME. These markers were then used with the *SCINA* package to assign specific identities to the normal cells.     Finally, to validate and further characterize the annotations, we used the *signifinder* package to assess functional signatures related to cancer metabolism and cellular mechanisms, providing deeper insights into cell behavior within the TME.       To achieve our primary objective—identifying a robust set of gene markers for both known and previously uncharacterized cell types and subtypes—we begin with a thorough cell-type annotation. In the second phase of our analysis, we employ unsupervised clustering to identify distinct sub-clusters within the major cell populations. This approach allows us to detect cellular heterogeneity that may reflect unique behaviors, such as adaptation to specific metastatic sites or emergence after initial chemotherapy. By analyzing differentially expressed genes within each cluster, we aim to statistically validate and define meaningful subpopulations, ultimately associating significant marker genes with each distinct cluster.       We aim for our pipeline to establish a clear, reproducible framework for cell-type annotation—one that is both biologically grounded and statistically robust. By promoting methodological transparency and precision, we hope to contribute a scalable and accurate strategy for the annotation of complex single-cell datasets.",laura.masatti@unipd.it,"I am currently in the second year of my postdoc at the University of Padova in Italy.

While bulk gene-expression signatures have played a key role, advances in single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics highlight tumor heterogeneity, requiring computational tools for precise characterization. To address this, we developed signifinder, an R Bioconductor package that streamlines the collection and application of cancer transcriptional signatures across bulk, single-cell, and spatial transcriptomics data. Leveraging publicly available signatures, users can assess tumor characteristics, therapy responses, and tumor microenvironment features.  Indeed, cancer gene expression research has generated numerous transcriptional signatures that aid in tumor classification, prognosis, and therapeutic decisions. These signatures, composed of specific gene sets, provide insights into tumor biology and interactions with the tumor microenvironment. However, tumor heterogeneity presents challenges, requiring tools that define cancer cell states within high-resolution transcriptomic data. Advancements in single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics have revealed tumors as complex cellular mosaics shaped by spatial patterns and clonal variations. Computational tools are needed to analyze gene expression modules and derive cell-specific scores. While pan-cancer analyses confirm multiple, non-mutually exclusive cancer cell states, a comprehensive catalog of gene modules remains elusive, limiting genomic data interpretation. Despite extensive research, bulk transcriptional signatures face reproducibility and standardization challenges, with few adopted in clinical practice. Open-source implementations are lacking, restricting usability. To bridge this gap, we developed signifinder, a package that implements public transcriptional signatures across transcriptomic data types. It ensures interoperability within Bioconductor workflows, enabling systematic signature evaluation. Signifinder integrates bulk, single-cell, and spatial transcriptomic signatures, compiling a collection of cancer gene signatures, and enables intra-tumor heterogeneity analysis.

This co-transcriptional modification can alter the coding sequence of mRNAs or regulate gene expression and is involved in fundamental processes as neural development and immune response.  To allow a quantitative comparison of ADAR1 activity in various RNA-seq samples, the Alu Editing Index (AEI) was developed by Roth, Shalom Hillel et al., Nature methods (2019). The AEI measures ADAR1 activity in Alu as the ratio of A-to-G mismatches in the total number of adenosines in Alu elements. Therefore, the AEI needs to start from the raw reads. This hampered AEI usability when raw reads are not available or when RNA-seq 3’ end libraries are used, including single cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomic data. To overcome these issues, we developed a tool to globally quantify ADAR activity (not only specific to the Alu sites) starting from the expression matrix.  We created four transcriptional ADAR signatures (Neuronal Human, Neuronal Mouse, Inflammation Human, Cancer related) leveraging several bulk RNA-Seq datasets with the knock-out (or knock-down) of ADAR1, ADAR2 or both in different conditions (neuronal development, mouse neurons, cancer cell related, interferon stimulation). The signatures were defined as the regulons extracted from the network reconstructed obtained by gene expression matrices, where regulons are defined as the first neighbors of the ADAR genes. ADAR signatures are calculated with the R package viper. The robustness of the signatures was tested by applying them across validation datasets of bulk, single-cell and spatial transcriptomics datasets. The results obtained suggest that the developed signatures can be employed to get reliable ADARs’ activity scores specific to each biological context.  Hence, we developed an R package that will be available on GitHub and submitted to Bioconductor.

While the package appears relevant to the Bioconductor community, it is a CRAN package, so I would suggest a poster presentation; Quality: This is a high quality, published package, that has been made even faster and has added new features. The visualization features are quite fluid and well-done, and the documentation is good, though not extensive (just one vignette on CRAN). I have personally installed the package-- it needs documentation and the dependencies need fixing, but it works at this point. The D3 visualization is an attractive point of the vignette and the ability to choose the best clustering algorithm allows one to justify steps taken in an analysis in a way that is not arbitrary.Significance: scRNA-seq is a highly popular area at the conference and cluster evaluation is important.Originality: The package allows for validation by perturbing the network between 0 and 60%, which shows how stable the algorithm is. The bit about differing resolutions and pipelines is not really talked about in the new vignette,  but I assume it will be.

Computational genomic approaches are increasingly used to screen large biological datasets and identify features capable of classifying or predicting phenotypes. While traditionally focused on single-omics data, integration of multi-omics data enhances biomarker selection by capturing additional layers of biological variation.  Matrix factorization methods have emerged as a powerful tool for multi-omics analysis, as they can learn latent factors that capture significant heterogeneity across different data types. However, each of the current multi-omics factorization algorithms presents its own strengths and weaknesses. Distinct approaches may result into different biomarker sets, therefore causing loss of potentially valuable information. Ultimately, reconciling different biomarker sets identified by distinct methods is difficult and error-prone.  To contribute to addressing these questions, we undertook a combinatorial approach. We used a TCGA, multi-omics breast cancer dataset of 150 samples comprising of transcriptomics, proteomics, and microRNA profiles. We utilized this dataset to: 1) perform multi-omics factorization using 10 distinct algorithms or algorithm variants thereof, including DIABLO, PCA (principal component analysis), MOFA (multi-omics factor analysis), NMF (non-negative matrix factorization), WGCNA (weighted gene correlation network analysis), SGCCA (sparse generalized CCA), SGCCDA (sparse generalized canonical correlation discriminant analysis), RGCCA (regularized generalized CCA), RGCCDA (regularized generalized canonical correlation discriminant analysis), MCIA (multiple co-inertia analysis); 2) combined results of all methods into a variable importance measure to identify a robust set of biomarkers; 3) compared the distinct methods to assess concordance between methods.   All methods were able to predict a set of biomarkers. However, as anticipated, non overlapping biomarker features between methods were often observed. It remains challenging to determine the optimal criteria for selecting the most appropriate factorization approach. For example, distinct data types or data modalities may require tailored approaches. We conducted comparison between methods and found that PCA, MOFA, NMF are more similar to each other compared to other methods. This can be explained by algorithm similarity. For instance, both PCA and MOFA attempt to explain the maximum variance into a small set of components or factors created as an approximated linear combination of the original variables from each data modality. Also, as expected, canonical correlation analysis (CCA) methods, including SGCCA, RGCCA, SGCCDA were highly correlated with each other. We also found that DIABLO, a widely used supervised learning factorization method, was highly correlated with SGCCDA. Correlation analysis also revealed significant divergence between methods. For instance, both PCA and MOFA were lowly correlated with MCIA (multiple co-inertia analysis). We computed a variable importance score for each method. An aggregated score is then calculated as the cumulative rank of the variable importances of the different algorithms. To define a robust set of biomarkers, we select the best predictive features as those with the highest cumulative ranks.   Combining classifications from multiple multi-omics integration methods delivers more robust biomarkers bypassing the risk of information loss from single methods.",ivo.kwee@bigomics.ch,No,,,,

However, the huge number of missing values and technical batch effects result in challenges for data analysis. This hinders a first key step in the data analysis workflow, i.e., dimensionality reduction, important for data exploration, visualization, and QC, as well as for downstream applications such as clustering cells. To this end, chained workflows are currently used that sequentially impute missing values, correct for batch effects, and perform conventional principal component analysis. However, their results depend on the order of the tools used in the workflow. Moreover, missingness is influenced by batch effects, so there is no guarantee that chained workflows lead to optimal, interpretable, or reliable results.  We present omicsGMF, the first package for proteomics that integrates dimensionality reduction, batch correction and missing value imputation within a single framework. It builds on our sgdGMF framework, which uses a stochastic gradient descent for generalized matrix factorization and was previously used for dimensionality reduction on single cell RNA-sequencing data. omicsGMF is optimized for omics data and is here applied to a diverse set of bulk and single-cell proteomics data. omicsGMF can be easily used on SummarizedExperiment, SingleCellExperiment and QFeatures classes, and can model the data using different members of the exponential family, such as Gaussian, Poisson or negative binomial distributions.  In this contribution we first show that omicsGMF improves the quality of dimensionality reduction and visualization, while simultaneously addressing batch effect removal and missing values. Second, omicsGMF can assist the user to select the optimal dimensionality by cross-validation, which improves downstream analysis. Furthermore, we illustrate how it can be used for imputation of missing values, resulting in superior imputation performance than state-of-the-art imputation tools, which in turn leads to superior sensitivity and specificity in downstream differential abundance analyses. By providing an all-in-one solution for dimensionality reduction, batch correction and imputation that is highly interpretable, omicsGMF addresses a critical gap in proteomics data analysis for single cell and large-scale applications.",lieven.clement@ugent.be,No,,,,

However, current SCP data analysis workflows still focus on comparing average protein abundances and overlook informative distributional changes in shape, such as differences in variability and/or modality, limiting the advantage of SCP over bulk proteomics. We therefore propose a novel statistical framework for SCP data to infer distributional differences between conditions.   Our method builds on Lindsey’s Method, which recasts the density estimation into a Poisson regression problem i.e., by fitting smooth histograms with a large number of equally spaced bins using a basis function expansion. In this contribution we enable interpretable inference on differences in the abundance distributions between conditions by using interactions between the spline basis and an experimental factor.   We illustrate how our modelling approach can prioritize proteins that exhibit differential distributions across conditions using likelihood ratio tests and Wald-tests. These tests assess the omnibus null hypothesis of a common density across conditions. Next, we develop tests on pairwise contrasts between the groupwise smoothers to infer regions with distributional differences between conditions. This approach also enabled us to provide our users with intuitive plots that visualize the density estimators in both conditions, highlight regions with differential distributions, and have a one-to-one relation to the models and hypothesis tests that we propose.   Finally, we evaluate and illustrate our novel framework using simulation studies and real SCP experiments. These analyses show that our comprehensive distributional analysis framework is a first step to leverage the wealth of information in SCP data.

Most current methods model these changes by fitting gene-wise generalized linear models to read counts, and then detect differential expression using statistical tests such as the likelihood-ratio test or the quasi-likelihood F-test \citep{edgeR}. Each gene $\times$ cell pair occurs only once in the dataset and is observed under a single condition. Predicting counterfactual expression levels---e.g., estimating how a cell would express genes under treatment even if observed under control---increases sample size by imputing expression values for all conditions. This might reduce false discovery rates and improve detection power, both key to efficient statistical testing.  The method LEMUR \citep{lemur} addresses this imputation task using a type of PCA that learns for each cell a low-rank structure per condition. The flexibility of the model makes uncertainty more challenging to quantify, an open problem as stated by the authors of LEMUR. Our conformeR is a wrapper around LEMUR R-package that adds uncertainty quantification without altering the underlying model. conformeR constructs prediction intervals for LEMUR-imputed values with finite-sample coverage guarantees using conformal prediction \citep{cpvovk}, which relies on the assumption that cells from the same biological replicate and cell type are exchangeable.   By inverting conformal prediction intervals, conformeR outputs for each gene $\times$ cell pair a p-value that encodes the difference between the observed and predicted expression levels. We then adjust these p-values using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure \citep{bh_correction}, leveraging the fact that conformal p-values satisfy the positive regression dependence on a subset condition \citep{pval_prds}. Finally, conformeR aggregates over cells from the same replicate and cell type to yield a single p-value per gene.  We evaluate conformeR on scRNA-seq data from 864 patients with varying Covid-19 severity \citep{scMerge2}. The large cohort allows us to account for patient-level variability and demonstrate the robustness and power of conformeR.",justine.leclerc@usz.ch,"I am a first-year PhD student in Biostatistics and Epidemiology at the University of Zurich (UZH) and the University Hospital Zurich (USZ), Switzerland.

This year, we announce edgeR version 4 with expanded functionality and improved support for small counts and larger datasets.  We introduce a new quasi-likelihood (QL) method in edgeR 4.0.0, using the adjusted deviance statistics to yield very nearly unbiased quasi-dispersion estimators even for fitted values close to zero. We only estimate a constant NB-dispersion from the most highly expressed genes which is fast even for larger dataset. We update the empirical Bayes hyperparameter estimation in edgeR 4.4.0, to give improved performance when the residual degree of freedom are unequal and possibly small. Recently we introduce a new diffSplice method for alternative splicing analysis in edgeR 4.6.0.  With those expanded functionality, we can apply edgeR to single-cell RNA-seq data analysis. For example, we can identify the highly variable genes using the goodness-of-fit test for one sample or multiple samples. We can also find the marker genes for the cell clusters using one vs the average of others approach instead of pseudo-bulk approach which only works for more than two samples. Besides, the new diffSplice method is designed for alternative splicing by differential transcript usage or differential exon usage analysis.

There is no publication associated with this contribution and no URL with the current available code of the method or the analyses described.  The approach sounds interesting enough for a short talk, but the lack of publication and code casts a bit of doubt on how mature the approach actually is.; This work deals with a new method of great interest for the research community.; Quality: This study suggested that they are actually doing comparisons with existing methods. I'm impressed. It's an interesting idea, essentially using the regulatory network to predict regulatory activity of the TFs. It is questionable how they're planning to validate this-- I would have hoped they were using  position weight matrix data of existing TF databases to understand how well their model works (e.g. JASPAR). They might also consider using contact data or enhancer databases (e.g. Genehancer) that give the strength of enhancer association. I would also hope that enhancer databases were used to select the regions and that the measurements are done in the appropriate cell types for this study.Originality: They appear to have said they plan to cover themselves by a comparison, but they fail to mention what other methods they are comparing against. This may be because of limited space in the abstract, but at least they are planning on it. I do think the method of using a network with RNA-seq to predict TF activity.Clarity: They have a clear plan & path towards publication, it seems, but the details are sparse as to whether they are properly matching cell types for the analysis. They say that they can incorporate prior information about the TF and target gene, but fail to say exactly how they have done that and shown it improves the model. Significance: predicting TF activity in enhancers is critical to understanding if GWAS hits are really functional and can help to improve detection power by narrowing the list of candidates that have high TF activity. I think it's a very important problem to be studying, though they didn't make the case of this point in their abstract.Overall: I think it's an interesting method and they are careful to have good plans. It is very early to say if their results are going to pan out. There is no package currently to look at or evaluate.

Contemporary single-cell studies simultaneously measure genome-wide transcription levels for thousands of individual cells in a single experiment. While the characterization of cell population differences has often occurred through differential expression analysis, tiny effect sizes become statistically significant when thousands of cells are available for each population, compromising biological interpretation. Moreover, these large studies have spurred the development of methods to infer gene regulatory networks (GRNs) directly from the data, and GRN databases are becoming more comprehensive.          In this work, we propose a statistical model for gene expression measures and an inference method that leverage GRNs to deconvolve transcription factor (TF) activity from gene expression, by probabilistically assigning mRNA molecules to TFs. This shifts the paradigm from investigating gene expression differences to regulatory differences at the level of TF activity, aiding interpretation and allowing prioritization of a limited number of TFs responsible for significant contributions to the observed gene expression differences. The inferred TF activities result in intuitive prioritization of TFs in terms of the (difference in) estimated number of molecules they produce, in contrast to other widely-used methods relying on arbitrary enrichment scores. Our model allows the incorporation of prior information on the regulatory potential between each TF and target gene through prior distributions, and is able to deal with both repressing and activating interactions. We compare our approach to other TF activity estimation methods using simulation experiments and case studies.",kvande14@its.jnj.com,No,,,,

For example, omics-focused studies of biological processes can paint a more holistic picture of complex diseases, such as cancer or neurodegenerative diseases. From this perspective, we developed our R package MOSClip, which was recently added to BioConductor. MOSClip integrates multiple omics by implementing graph theory methods for topological analysis of biological pathways. It performs dimensionality reduction, which can be done at two levels: whole pathways or decomposition of pathways into modules. Then, MOSClip can either evaluate the impact of each pathway and omic on patients’ prognosis through survival analysis, or operate a two-class analysis. Additionally, MOSClip offers multiple graphical tools to aid in the visualization of the results.  The last released version of our R package supports bulk RNA-sequencing, methylation, mutation, and copy number variation data. A new addition to MOSClip is the support for ATAC-seq data, and we are further developing it to accept single-cell data. To illustrate and confirm the utilities and performance of this package, we conducted multiple case studies using multi-omics data from different complex diseases. Specifically, we focused on the new functionalities of MOSClip, including the two-class analysis. MOSClip is a valuable tool for its ability to give powerful insights into complex diseases that could pass undetected otherwise. This is achieved thanks to the topological analysis and the built-in MOSClip graph functions, allowing quick and intuitive interpretation of the results.

I learned about the European Bioconductor Conference through my friends and colleagues from my PhD studies who attended last year’s conference. I was amazed by reports I was told about the EuroBioC 2024 talks and programme, with important keynote speakers, useful package demos, and interesting short talks. Later, revisiting the programme myself, I was convinced and excited to attend this year’s edition of EuroBioC.  I am a second-year PhD student at the University of Padua, Italy, and my academic journey started in Brazil. I did my undergraduate studies in Biology at the University of Campinas (Unicamp), which led me to a master’s studies in bioinformatics at the University of Padua. Nonetheless, I always seek to enhance my academic experience even further, and attending conferences is a great opportunity to achieve this.  Presenting your work, receiving feedback, and networking are essential for academic success. I firmly believe these activities' benefits are not only on the personal level, but also on a whole community scale. The spread of knowledge and ideas exchange strengthens us as a society and fuels science. Therefore, I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to attend the EuroBioC conference.  This conference perfectly aligns with my project and my lab research field. Our works are mostly focused on creating bioinformatics tools, especially R packages, to study biological pathways and functions applied to cancer. My PhD project includes the development of two R packages, one of which is already available at BioConductor. Hence, the EuroBioC conference is the best match for my project, and I am sure I have much to contribute to the academic community.  I hope this conference will allow me to share our lab studies, and most importantly, listen to our peers’ opinions and ideas. I expect to enhance my networking and social skills while being updated on the latest scientific discoveries firsthand. This would potentially grow our community by cultivating new collaborations.  However, participating in conferences as an international student is not trivial. Dealing with the costs of living abroad, dealing with international bureaucracy can be economically and personally challenging. Visiting your home country becomes a luxury, and intelligent budget planning becomes a necessity. Moreover, as part of a smaller lab, I am conscious that I cannot always depend on personal or lab resources. Our funds are limited and my colleagues need them as much as myself. Therefore, I am hereby gently appealing to the commission to judge me worthy and grant me the travel fellowship.  In conclusion, I am thrilled with the opportunity to attend the EuroBioC 2025 Conference and present my work. This would be a perfect experience for me as a second-year PhD student, which perfectly aligns with my curriculum and project. Further information about my academic background and skills can be found on my CV (https://ohmproject.my.canva.site/annaceltanadacv).

These advantages make ATAC-seq particularly well-suited for identifying transcription factors (TFs) that mediate regulatory changes between cell types or states. However, technical biases inherent to ATAC-seq data can complicate downstream analyses, especially the accurate identification of differentially active TFs. A recent benchmarking study identified a variation of $chromVAR$ as the preferred method for this task, but we observed that it suffers from an incomplete and computationally intensive bias correction strategy and overlooks the footprint characteristics of TF binding. To address these limitations, we developed two alternative approaches: the weighted and insertion models.   The weighted model corrects GC-content and fragment length biases in ATAC-seq data by assigning weights to fragments, followed by cyclic loess normalization to calculate peak weights for enrichment bias correction. The resulting unbiased peak accessibility matrix is then used for differential motif accessibility analysis with $limma$-$voom$. Unlike $chromVAR$, which generates motif-level scores, the unbiased peak-level accessibility count matrix produced by the weighted model enables broader downstream analyses, such as peak-level differential accessibility analysis and bias-corrected coverage profiles for visualization. We therefore envision that the weighted model will have broader applicability to bulk epigenetic data, providing unbiased information for a variety of downstream analyses at multiple levels.  The insertion model enhances differential motif accessibility analysis by incorporating Tn5 footprint patterns around motif sites, assigning weighted insertion scores per motif match. Bias correction is performed using $chromVAR$-like background peaks, and differential motif accessibility is assessed using z-scores and $limma$.  Each of these two models offers enhanced statistical performance, with the weighted model effectively correcting various technical biases. As a future direction, we aim to integrate the weighted and insertion models into a unified framework that leverages both fragment-level bias correction and motif-specific footprint signals for more robust differential motif accessibility analysis.",jiayi.wang2@uzh.ch,No,,,,

Through the Bioconductor Carpentry program, we have trained 31 instructors in the last two years, developed structured training materials on R/Bioconductor, RNA-seq and single-cell analysis, and delivered 28+ workshops globally. To address the growing demand for in-person training, we have partnered with local bioinformatics leaders to deliver on-site workshops in East and West Africa.  In March 2025, we held a highly successful week-long workshop in Nairobi, Kenya, in collaboration with the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) and international experts. The course provided hands-on training in genomic data analysis and RNA-seq workflows, enabling participants to apply Bioconductor tools to their own datasets. More details: training.bioconductor.org/workshops/2025-03-Nairobi . We plan to run a similar course in West Africa in late 2025 / early 2026.  We aim to connect with and support the African bioinformatics community by: - Expanding instructor networks to increase local training capacity. - Identifying needs and gaps in bioinformatics training and tools to ensure our initiatives are needs-based. - Developing region-specific curricula for One Health research, including pathogen and agricultural genomics. - Collaborating with African bioinformatics institutions to scale training opportunities. - Providing opportunities to get involved in developing training materials in local languages.  This presentation will highlight progress to date, lessons learned, and future opportunities, inviting researchers and educators from around the world to join Bioconductor’s growing global community and contribute to bioinformatics education.",laurahondari22@gmail.com,No,,,,

Several methods have been developed to identify spatially variable genes (SVGs), i.e., genes whose expression profiles vary across tissue. As multi-sample, multi-condition SRT datasets (e.g., healthy vs. diseased, different treatments, or time points) become more common, it can be of interest to identify differences between conditions, such as genes with different abundances or splicing patterns. However, current methods face several limitations: (i) lack of support for multiple samples and conditions; (ii) high computational demands; and, (iii) inability to test for spatial changes of gene expression patterns across groups.  Methodology  Here, we present an extension of our previous DESpace framework for identifying genes with differential spatial patterns (DSP) across conditions in multi-sample settings. The method inputs pre-computed spatial domains, i.e., regions of neighboring spots with similar expression profiles, usually identified by spatially resolved clustering tools. We then pseudo-bulk gene expression within each domain and sample, and use edgeR with spatial clusters and conditions as covariates. Intuitively, if the expression  is significantly associated with the interaction terms between spatial clusters and condition, the spatial gene expression structure varies between conditions, hence indicating DSP. Key strengths of our method include: (i) modeling of multiple samples across multiple conditions, reducing uncertainty from individual samples and identifying genes with DSP across experimental conditions; (ii) region-specific testing, allowing investigation of the mRNA abundance changes between conditions in areas of particular interest; and, (iii) computational efficiency and compatibility with diverse SRT platforms.  Benchmarking  We benchmarked our method against scran's findMarkers, Seurat's FindMarkers (with and without pseudo-bulk aggregation), and spatialLIBD, using semi-simulated datasets generated from two real SRT datasets, with four known spatial expression patterns. In simulations, our approach exhibits well-calibrated false discovery rates and higher true positive rates, while on real datasets, our framework identified more condition-associated genes than the competitors.  Availability  Our approach is available via Bioconductor: https://bioconductor.org/packages/DESpace.  A pre-print (in preparation) will also follow in the coming weeks.",peiying.cai@uzh.ch,No,,,,

It's a very useful addition and I think what the author did is difficult if it was done well. **Clarity**:Very well written and understandable.**Originality**:This is not the only package to do spatial functional data analysis in R, clearly, but does represent an advance to a well-established and popular package that will benefit the bioconductor community.**Significance**:Generalized additive mixture models are very difficult to put into a usable package that actually converges properly and quickly. If this abstract is true in that it is a very usable package, it was difficult to do and should drastically improve the flexibility of spatial FDA, which is a highly used package in a very popular field. I imagine this will be an excellent paper with quite a few citations. I think it's well above the bar for acceptance to the conference and I would be very interested to hear more.

It does allow interpretation of the scale of the effect across increasing r.What is missing is an elaboration of how this is a mixture model when the correlation structure is not specified. It does not appear as though this is present as the abstract suggests, but I imagine it will be complete in time for the conference, and will be quite impressive. I do not see any examples of using different types of correlation structures (toeplitz, etc) and hope that is forthcoming.I also do not see any measures of how easily this new model is to converge and how quickly it does so in different sample size conditions. Further, I do not see any measure that the additive model provides better fit, and the same for the ability to add a correlation structure (mixture model) on a real dataset or how much the GAM (with or without a correlation structure) changes estimates.

There are many standard tools to quantify different aspects of spatial data (e.g. cellular colocalisation). Most of these tools do not provide a way to compare multiple samples across conditions with statistical models. The existing approaches that allow for such a comparison across samples focus on comparing scalar metrics.   Our Bioconductor package, spatialFDA, takes a different approach by using spatial metrics that quantify so-called $r$-neighbourhoods with increasing radii $r$, thereby constructing the spatial metric as function of the radius $r$. Instead of compressing these functions into scalar values, spatialFDA compares the entire functions between conditions using generalised additive mixed models with functional responses. This estimation framework allows to account for the complex correlational structure of spatial omics datasets. The estimated coefficients of these models are themselves functions over the user-defined radius range. This allows for an interpretation of the scale of the differential co-localisation effect between conditions.   The methodology of spatialFDA was extended and improved to reflect the characteristics of spatial statistics functions. This entailed improved estimation of random errors, optimising the identifiability of the model and specifying suitable link functions. We show that spatialFDA can be used to find biologically-meaningful differential co-localisation of cell types in different biological examples.

While these images are routinely used in cancer research and diagnosis, their computational analysis typically requires specialized software outside the R/Bioconductor ecosystem, the primary environment for other high-throughput omics analyses. This disconnection creates a significant barrier to integrative multi-model analyses. To address this challenge, we aim to develop standardized workflows for processing raw histopathological images and making extract features available in R, along with a comprehensive repository of pre-processed features from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) images.  We developed a comprehensive image analysis pipeline that includes color normalization, tissue segmentation, tiling, and feature extraction at the nuclei and region-of-interest (ROI) levels. The pipeline leverages state-of-the-art deep learning models, including HoVer-Net for nuclear segmentation and classification, and outputs standardized data structures compatible with R/Bioconductor's existing analytical frameworks. We validated this workflow by processing the complete collection of diagnostic H&E-stained whole slide images (WSIs) from TCGA.  We established a standardized histopathology image analysis pipeline and implemented it on 11,765 diagnostic images from 9,640 cases across 25 cancer types. Extracted nuclei-level features included location, shape, texture, and classification (e.g., benign, neoplastic, stromal and necrotic), while ROI-level features captured tissue organization, cellular composition, and spatial relationships. We further demonstrated the use case of multi-model integration across extracted image features, genomics, and transcriptomics data. Finally, to enhance the usability of this resource, we developed ImageTCGA, a Shiny application for interactive exploration, filtering, and visualization of the extracted features with the original images.  Our standardized workflow and feature repository bridge a critical gap between histopathological image analysis and multi-omics integration. By providing robust tools within the R/Bioconductor environment, along with pre-computed features from TCGA, we enable researchers to readily incorporate spatial and morphological insights into their analyses. ImageTCGA facilitates hypothesis generation and validation across diverse cancer types, potentially accelerating biomarker discovery and advancing our understanding of tumor-microenvironment interactions.

The barcode count for each sample indicates the number of progeny cells derived from the original cell. However, there is a lack of bioinformatic tools for robust statistical analysis of barcode count data from bulk sequencing of DNA barcodes.   To address this, we introduce barbieQ, an Bioconductor R package designed for analysing barcode count data across groups of samples. barbieQ is built upon the widely used SummarizedExperiment data structure, making it interoperable with low-level processing tools. It provides novel functions for data cleaning, summarising, and visualising barcode count data, and implements two statistical tests:  1) Differential barcode proportion - identifies barcodes with significantly changing proportions in one condition compared to another. 2) Differential barcode occurrence - identifies barcodes more frequently seen in the samples of one condition compared to another.  barbieQ can handle complex experimental designs using regression models to test a factor of interest while taking into account other variables. Both tests maintain a type 1 error less than 5% under the null hypothesis. Notably, in analysis of a real world dataset of monkey blood stem cell differentiation, barbieQ accurately identified novel NK cell-specific clones whilst avoiding less specific barcodes, in contrast to the original analysis based on heuristic cutoffs and visualisations commonly used in the field.

There is an increasing need to develop robust and reproducible methods that take into account current and future trends in microbiome research such as multi-omics, expanding datasets, and longitudinal study designs.  The previous solutions in microbiomics have fallen short in addressing these modern requirements, particularly in terms of scalability and data integration. To meet these challenges, the research community has extended the widely adopted SummarizedExperiment data container to TreeSummarizedExperiment, enabling support for microbiome-specific data structures such as hierarchical relationships. The framework is further enriched with mia (Microbiome Analysis) package family and packages by independent developers, providing methods for common data operations, visualization, and advanced analytical approaches.  This session will showcase the latest advances in microbiome data science within Bioconductor, focusing on the mia (Microbiome Analysis) framework through a practical case study. We will also present Orchestrating Microbiome Analysis with Bioconductor, a freely available online book designed to promote best practices and facilitate adoption of the ecosystem. Together, these resources form a foundation for reproducible, scalable, and transparent microbiome data science, and they continue to evolve through active community contributions.",tvborm@utu.fi,No,,,,

Good option for workshop.",workshop,,,"Workshop;Workshop;Workshop,Poster",3,2,"Christophe Vanderaa,Laurent Gatto,Lieven Clement",Ghent University,male,"Proteomics,Statistical methodology",,"Mass spectrometry (MS) has become a method of choice for exploring the proteome landscape that drives cellular functions. While technological advancements have significantly increased the sensitivity of MS instruments, obtaining reliable statistical results from these data remains a challenging and often tedious task. Many researchers continue to rely on ad-hoc analysis workflows due to a lack of clear guidelines, which can lead to violations of key statistical assumptions. In this workshop, we will offer a hands-on introduction to the msqrob2 package that provides a set of rigorously validated and benchmarked statistical workflows for MS-based proteomics. These workflows are built on the QFeatures framework for data processing. We will begin by familiarising participants with the input data format and the QFeatures data structure. From there, we will walk through the minimal data processing steps required prior to statistical modelling, explaining when and why each step is necessary. Next, we’ll explore the sources of variation inherent in proteomics data, highlighting their hierarchical structure and demonstrating how linear mixed models can properly account for these complexities. The modelling process will be carried out using msqrob2, which offers additional advantages such as robust and stabilised parameter estimation. Finally, we will demonstrate how to translate biological questions into hypothesis tests and how to prioritise proteomic markers that change in response to a condition of interest. Depending on the progress of the group, we will also briefly explore the emerging field of single-cell proteomics, discussing the additional challenges posed by these data. This workshop is designed for proteomics researchers who want to learn how to analyse their data using reproducible and statistically sound workflows, as well as for omics data analysts interested in expanding their skill set to include proteomics.",christophe.vanderaa@ugent.be,"The Bioconductor project has played a pivotal role throughout my scientific career. I rely extensively on numerous Bioconductor packages in my daily analyses, and I have personally developed and currently maintain four Bioconductor packages. More recently, I’ve also taken on the role of package reviewer, further deepening my engagement with the community. Attending the EuroBioc conference is therefore a unique and essential opportunity for me. I’m particularly eager to present a workshop on recent developments in my work, engage in discussions around method development and software engineering, and connect with peers who share similar scientific goals. These interactions are not only intellectually enriching but also crucial for fostering new collaborations. As a postdoctoral researcher at Ghent University (Belgium), building a strong international network is key to my professional growth. EuroBioc offers an ideal platform to both solidify my standing in the Bioconductor community and take important steps toward establishing myself as an independent researcher with an international reputation.",,,,
